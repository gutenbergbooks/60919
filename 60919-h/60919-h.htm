<p class="noindent">This short work contains the story of five seasons’
climbing and exploring in the New Zealand Alps.
Most of the material embodied in it has already appeared
from time to time, in rather a different form,
in the Christchurch (N.Z.) ‘Weekly Press.’</p>

<p>The author trusts that the publication of the same
in book form, together with a map of the locality and
a few photographic reproductions, will supply a want
in the shape of a guide-book to the Alpine mountain
district which is already beginning to be felt by
tourists in New Zealand; and he hopes that the contents
may not prove uninteresting to the general public,
more especially to Swiss and Caucasian climbers, few
of whom are perhaps aware of the extent and nature of
the New Zealand Alpine chain.</p>

<p>The map is compiled by the New Zealand Government
Survey Office from the work of Mr. T. N. Brodrick,
Government Surveyor, and that of Dr. R. von
Lendenfeld. The illustrations are from photographs
by Messrs. Wheeler and Son. Their operator has in
several mountain expeditions accompanied the author,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>who takes this opportunity of expressing his thanks to
the New Zealand Government Survey Department, and
to Messrs. Wheeler, for their kind assistance.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be said that the summit of Aorangi
has not yet been attained: quite true. Like Mr. Green,
the author and his friend were ‘wise in time.’ Yet it
is only a quibble to dispute the ascent of the mountain,
for being on the ice-cap of Aorangi is like being on the
topmost rung of a ladder, and yet not upon the projections
above that step.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I</abbr><br />
<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h2>

<p class="center1"><i>The New Zealand Alps and their glaciers</i></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is unnecessary for me in these days of universal
education and enlightenment to describe the geographical
position of New Zealand, the ‘Britain of
the South,’ and the future playground of Australasia.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that New Zealand consists of three
islands, situate between the 34th and 47th degrees of
south latitude, off the south-east coast of Australia.
Reference to almost any handbook of the colony will
furnish every information regarding settlement, population,
government, climate, and so on, and I do not
propose to dwell longer than is necessary on any
general matters of this nature.</p>

<p>It is advisable, however, to describe in as brief and
concise a manner as possible the general physical
features of a country containing such varieties of
scenery and climate, more especially those of the South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Island (or Middle Island as it is sometimes called),
where the High Alps and their wonderful glaciers are
situated.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the highest mountains of New
Zealand may be said to run in a north-easterly direction
from the southernmost point of the South Island
through the whole country, like a vast backbone, to
the north-eastern point of the North Island.</p>

<p>The main formation of the mountains dates back to
Jurassic times, so that the geological structure may be
said to be one of great antiquity.</p>

<p>Volcanic action has long since ceased throughout
the South Island; but there are many active volcanoes
in the North, where a perfect wonderland of hot-springs,
solfataras, and silica terraces exists.</p>

<p>As a whole, the country is heavily timbered&mdash;more
thickly on the western parts, where the greater rainfall
occurs. This is notably the case in the South Island,
where the hot and moisture laden winds from tropical
regions are deprived by the Alpine chain of their
aqueous vapour.</p>

<p>The Southern Alps proper may be said to extend
over a distance of about one hundred miles of the
middle part of the South Island, the chain being
situated closer to the western than the eastern ocean.
The slopes on the western side are the more precipitous,
and are clothed with heavy timber and intersected by
innumerable mountain torrents, fed in most cases by
glaciers, some of which descend to within 600 feet of
sea-level.</p>

<p>Ranges of outlying foot-hills occur on the eastern
side, snow-covered in winter, amongst which many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>large glacier-fed rivers have cut their way, and meander
over the plains (probably of entirely fluviatile formation)
which slope gradually from the outer bases of
the foot-hills to the eastern ocean.</p>

<p>The peaks of the Alps range in height from 7,000
to 12,350 feet above sea-level, the majority of those
over 10,000 feet being contiguous to the culminating
point in altitude&mdash;Aorangi&mdash;more popularly known as
Mount Cook. Here also are found the largest glaciers.</p>

<p>The snow-line is a low one when compared with
that of Alpine countries in the northern hemisphere
and in relative latitudes. It would be difficult to
compute its average altitude, but in parts where large
glaciers and snow-fields exist it is even as low as 5,000
feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>By comparison with Switzerland, for instance, it
may safely be said that the snow-line in New Zealand
is from 2,000 to 3,000 feet lower; consequently we
have the same Alpine conditions at a much lower
level. Owing to this interesting fact, we find that the
New Zealand glaciers attain far greater dimensions
than those of Switzerland, although the peaks do not
rise to such a height above sea-level.</p>

<p>In themselves, I believe the mountains compare
favourably as to size or actual height above the valleys
below them; Aorangi, for instance, rising for nearly
10,000 feet from the Hooker Glacier, and Mount
Sefton 8,500 feet from the Mueller Glacier, whilst the
western precipices of Mount Tasman (11,475 feet) are
stupendous.</p>

<p>The enormous length attained in remote times by
the New Zealand glaciers is evident on all hands at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the lower parts of the valleys, the heads of which they
now occupy; whilst the formation of nearly all the
lakes in the South Island can be traced to the action of
ice and the deposition of terminal moraines, prior to a
period of retreat of the ice.</p>

<p>There is an interesting feature in the glaciers of
this country peculiar to them; I refer to the deposition
of singularly extensive moraines. The lower parts
of the large glaciers on the eastern slopes are, in nearly
every instance, completely covered with accumulated
<em>débris</em> derived from the moraines. This is variously
accounted for by the antiquity of the mountain chain,
the slow rate of motion in the ice, and great denudation
from rocks which are much jointed and offer but
little resistance to the splitting powers of freezing infiltrated
water.</p>

<p>The western glaciers I am not personally acquainted
with, but I understand that they do not carry anything
like the amount of moraine, and I imagine the cause of
the disparity will be found in a faster motion of the
ice, and (a yet more potent factor) in the dip of
the strata of the rocks, which is from east to west,
the broken faces being eastward and the slab-like
faces westward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />
<small>THE ROUTE TO THE MOUNT COOK DISTRICT</small></h2>

<p class="hang50center"><i>A short description of the route to the Mount Cook district, and of
the topographical features of the Mueller, Hooker, and Tasman
Valleys</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Timaru on the east coast the traveller may comfortably
reach the glaciers of Aorangi in a two days’
journey.</p>

<p>Leaving Timaru by an evening train, Fairlie Creek
(the present terminus of the railway line) is reached,
where the night is spent. Two days’ coaching then are
required to cross over Burke’s Pass into the great Mackenzie
plains, across this great ancient glacier bed, past
Lakes Tekapo and Pukaki, over the rivers of the same
names, and up the valley of the Tasman River to a comfortable
hostelry called ‘The Hermitage,’ nestling right
under the shadow of that wonderful pile of ice-clad
mountain glory, Mount Sefton.</p>

<p>Lakes Tekapo and Pukaki may both be aptly compared
in one way to the Lake of Geneva, in that they
are of glacier origin, and purify the rivers which now
flow from the present glaciers, parting with their waters
again through channels cut in the ancient terminal
moraines which dam their respective southern shores.</p>

<p>They are both beautiful, each in its own way&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Tekapo sunny, peaceful, and calm; Pukaki awe-inspiring
and grand&mdash;but they lack the charm of chalet and pine
tree, of vine and meadow, which so adorn the shores
of the Swiss lakes.</p>

<p>The immediate vicinity of the road is uninteresting,
except from a geological point of view, for it winds
about amongst old moraines, whose vegetation consists
almost entirely of the brown tussock grass so general
in the South Island.</p>

<p>Yet the geologist or student of glacier phenomena can read on
the surface the history of the formation; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roches moutonnées</i>
abound, and, in places, old moraines are spread over the bed rock
for miles together, whilst erratic blocks are dotted about in
various directions, evidencing how extensive has been the action
of the ice in ages gone by.</p>

<p>Though the scenes contiguous to the road may fail to charm the
eye, the distant panoramas of the glorious Southern Alps cannot fail
to draw forth expressions of wonder from the most callous observer.
As the Hermitage is approached, and the great peaks and glaciers draw
closer and closer, the marvellous grandeur of the chain is gradually
realised.</p>

<p>The sight of the reflection of Aorangi in Lake Tekapo, on a calm
morning, is something to remember for a lifetime. The subject has long
been a favourite one for brush and pen, but no one yet has done it
justice.</p>

<p>A substantial bridge spans the exit of the Tekapo River, but only a
ferry stage exists at the Pukaki River where it leaves the lake. A wire
rope, 450 feet long, is thrown across the stream, to which the ferry
stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> floating on two punts is attached by runners. The coach and four
is driven bodily on to the stage, and by the aid of a rudder the punts
are slued so as to point across the stream diagonally. The force of the
water rushing obliquely on to the sides of the punts drives the whole
affair across in a space of about three or four minutes. This ingenious
plan is commonly adopted in the New Zealand rivers.</p>

<p>During the months of winter it is possible to reach the Hermitage
direct from Tekapo, and thus avoid striking south to go round Lake
Pukaki, by crossing the Tasman River. During summer, however, as a
rule, this river is impassable, for it rises so fast during warm and
nor’-west weather from rain and melting snow that sometimes the whole
bed of the river—two miles wide—is a network of rushing yellow
torrents quite unfordable by man or beast.</p>

<p>Readers of the Rev. W. S. Green’s ‘<cite>High Alps of New
Zealand</cite>’ will recollect that his conveyance found a last
resting-place in the quicksands of the Tasman. Von Lendenfeld also,
the year after Mr. Green, experienced an unhappy week’s delay on the
eastern bank of the river. I have myself narrowly escaped drowning
at the same point, and in years gone by the Tasman River has been
accountable for more than one life.</p>

<p>The river in full flood is a sight to see; the water in places runs
fifteen knots an hour, or even more. In the rapids it is piled up in
the middle from sudden contraction of the banks, and forms crested
billows four or five feet in height, whilst now and then a block of ice
from the glacier may be seen bowling along.</p>

<p>The ancient glacier-formed terraces of the Tasman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> Valley are
instructive and interesting. The highest of them are distinctly marked
all down the valley for a distance of forty miles from Sebastopol—a
large face of ice-worn rock near the Hermitage—on the eastern slopes
of the Ben Ohau Range. The story of the ancient glacier can be read as
the eye follows these strange terraces from their starting point 2,000
feet above the valley bed, down a gentle declination to the terminus of
the Ben Ohau Range.</p>

<p>Before going into the narrative of my five seasons’ climbing amongst
the peaks and glaciers around Aorangi, it would be as well for me to
describe, as concisely as possible, the general topography of the
Mueller, Hooker, and Tasman Glaciers.</p>

<p>We will suppose ourselves in the main Tasman Valley, into which
all these glaciers drain, close to the point where the valley first
branches. As we look northward, Aorangi and the range running southward
for twelve miles from the main body of the mountain bound the view,
and divide the valley into two branches. Let us take the one to the
north-west first. Proceeding up this valley of the Hooker for a few
miles, we arrive at a branch valley from the left or west—the Mueller
Valley—completely occupied by the glacier of the same name. Close to
the Mueller Glacier is situated the Hermitage, presided over by Mr. F.
F. C. Huddleston, a true haven of refuge and comfort for the wearied
tourist or mountaineer.</p>

<div class="figcenter"> <a name="i_008fp.jpg" id="i_008fp.jpg"></a><img

VALLEY AND MOUNT SEFTON FROM GOVERNOR’S CAMP</span></p> <p
class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p> </div> </div>

<p>We step on to the Mueller Glacier, here completely covered by
moraine, and, turning westwards, strike up its course. On our right,
8,500 feet above us, clad in ice and snow and glittering in the
sunlight, rises the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> glorious mass of Mount Sefton, showering down
avalanches upon the glacier. On our left the shingle slips from the
rotten and crumbling crags of the Sealy Range. It is possible for
tourists who are good walkers to reach the head of this glacier, which
is seven and a half miles long and about one mile broad, in one day.
The moraine gives way to the clear ice some three miles or so from
the terminal face. Now we return and make a fresh start up the Hooker
Valley due northwards from the Hermitage.</p>

<p>Crossing the Mueller Glacier we walk through a perfect garden of
lilies (_ranunculus Lyallii_), celmisias, ‘Spaniards,’ and an endless
variety of sub-alpine plants, for a distance of about one mile from
the northern side of the Mueller Glacier, when we come to the terminal
moraine-covered face of the Hooker Glacier.</p>

<p>On our right rises up the bold and verdure clad snow-topped Mount
Cook Range, Mount Wakefield (6,561 feet), Mount Mabel (6,868 feet),
Mount Rosa (6,987 feet), and a nameless peak (7,540 feet) being the
principal points of interest. On our left is the northern continuation
of the ridge of Mount Sefton, known as the Moorhouse Range, part of the
main chain of the Southern Alps. Several secondary glaciers descend
from the slopes, but do not reach the bed of the valley below, which is
filled from side to side with the Hooker Glacier.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the surface of the glacier we get on to the clear ice,
and now on either bank the mountains rise to a great height. On the
right Aorangi suddenly rears itself, from a point known as the Ball
Saddle (7,500 feet), to 12,349 feet in one stupendous rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> ridge, upon
which the ice hangs wherever it can get any hold. This ridge is known
to climbers as the Great Southern _arête_, and has been found, first
by Mr. Green and secondly by myself, to be inaccessible. Right ahead
of us pour down from the highest crags the Mona, Noeline, and Empress
Glaciers, to join the Hooker, alternating with very precipitous rocky
ridges which present every appearance of being quite unscalable.</p>

<p>Several attempts have been made by surveyors and others to reach the
saddle at the head of the Hooker, but it was only in December 1890 that
the efforts of two climbers (Mr. A. P. Harper and Mr. R. Blakiston)
were rewarded. The expedition can only be attempted with any chance of
success in the early part of the season, when the numberless crevasses
are yet covered with the winter snow.</p>

<p>From the Hooker Glacier we turn our faces downwards to the south
again, and pay a visit to the north-eastern branch of the main Tasman
Valley.</p>

<p>Crossing the Hooker River at the terminal point of the Mount Cook
Range, where a cage swung on a wire rope over the river now facilitates
the traveller’s passage, we strike north-eastwards up the valley.</p>

<p>For a distance of four miles our way leads over the shingle and
boulder flats of the Tasman river-bed, here some two miles wide.
Patches of good sheep-feed consisting of tussock and cocksfoot grass
(the latter sown by an early settler) occur on the western side of the
valley, but the river as a rule washes the opposite slopes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"> <a name="i_010fp.jpg" id="i_010fp.jpg"></a><img
src="images/i_010fp.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="470" /><div
class="caption"> <p class="center"><span class="smaller">AORANGI: MOUNT
COOK AND THE HOOKER GLACIER.</span></p> <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler
&amp; Son, Photo.</i></p> </div> </div>

<p>Arriving at the terminal face of the glacier we strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> up a small
valley between the western lateral slopes of the moraine of the glacier
and the Mount Cook Range on our left, and for a distance of about seven
or eight miles force our way through dense scrub and loose boulders
from the moraine and mountain slopes, to the junction of the Ball
Glacier with the Tasman. This Ball Glacier comes from the Great
Southern _arête_ of Aorangi, and is fed almost entirely
by avalanches, there being no snow-fields&mdash;or <em>névés</em> as
they are called in Alpine parlance&mdash;of any great extent
at its head.</p>

<p>From this point upwards we strike out on to the ice
on our right, and another seven miles or so brings us to
a further division of the valley, Mount de la Bêche
being the dividing peak. The glacier of the left-hand
or northern branch is known as the Rudolf Glacier,
whilst the main body of the Tasman stretches some
six miles further north-eastwards to the Hochstetter
Dome, where it again divides. The saddle at the head
of the left-hand branch, again, has been reached by Dr.
von Lendenfeld and by myself in our respective ascents
of the Hochstetter Dome, and commands a superb view
of the Whymper Glacier and valley, and of the Wataroa
River on the west coast. The head of the branch to
the right of the Hochstetter Dome has not yet been
reached by man.</p>

<p>Taking a retrospective glance again at the peaks on
either hand, and commencing at the lower end of the
glacier, we have first on our right the Liebig Range till
opposite the Ball Glacier, when the <em>embouchure</em> of the
Murchison Valley occurs, followed by the Malte Brun
Range, with the main peak&mdash;the Matterhorn of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Zealand&mdash;opposite to Mount de la Bêche, then the
Darwin Glacier followed by the mountain of the same
name, and then the saddle between Mount Darwin and
the Hochstetter Dome.</p>

<p>Now, again, on the left or western side of the great
glacier we have the Mount Cook Range for ten miles,
the Ball Glacier, Aorangi, the Hochstetter Glacier,
Mounts Tasman, Haast, Haidinger, Glacier Peak,
Mounts Spencer, Kant, Rudolf (at the head of the
Rudolf Glacier), De la Bêche, Green, and Elie de
Beaumont, the last followed by the Lendenfeld Saddle,
to which I have already referred.</p>

<p>From Mount Tasman northwards to this saddle
all these mountains are situated in the main chain.
Aorangi itself, though popularly believed to belong to
the main divide, is in reality separated from it by a
rocky ridge and a saddle of about 10,500 feet, which
leads to the Hooker Glacier on the one hand and the
Linda on the other, both being east of the main divide.
Aorangi itself, therefore, consists of a divergent ridge,
the whole of whose drainage goes eastward.</p>

<p>Though for some years I have believed this to be
the case, it is only quite recently that I have been able
to substantiate the belief by ocular demonstration,
when the ascent of the mountain was accomplished
by Mr. Dixon and myself. To this expedition I shall
refer later on.</p>

<p>The reader must picture to himself the great Tasman
Glacier, nearly two miles in width and eighteen to
twenty in length, occupying the whole of the bed of
the valley, and fed on both sides by numerous tributary
ice streams from the mountains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the Murchison Valley it is not necessary for me
to speak just now, as the topographical features will be
described when I come to tell the story of its exploration.
Neither is it needful to refer in further detail to
the Tasman for the same reason.</p>

<small>FIRST ATTEMPT TO CLIMB AORANGI</small></h2>

<p class="center1"><i>First impressions&mdash;Swagging&mdash;The Hochstetter Glacier&mdash;Defeat&mdash;The
perils of river crossing</i></p>

<p class="center space-above">‘To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first.’</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was on March 24, 1886, that I left Christchurch, in
company with my cousin, Mr. C. D. Fox, on my first
visit to the great Tasman Glacier and Mount Cook, or
Aorangi.<a name="fnanchor_1_1" id="fnanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#fnanchor_1_1">[1]</a> The Maori name of Mount Cook is ‘Aorangi,’ or, more properly,
‘Ao-Rangi.’ The commonly accepted meaning of the term is ‘Sky-piercer’
but as the Maori language admits of many varieties of translation,
each version hovering about the region of true meaning, it is only
natural that authorities should differ as to the correct construing of the
word.
</p>
<p>
One good Maori scholar, whose reputation as such is almost pre-eminent,
gives the poetical translation of ‘Light of Day’&mdash;a singularly
beautiful one, for it is the first peak to catch the morning light and the
last to show the glow of evening.
</p>
<p>
Another very well-known Maori scholar, the Rev. J. W. Stack, assures
me that the most reasonable interpretation that can be put upon the word
‘Ao-Rangi’ is ‘Scud Peak’; and this is a singularly apt one, for the prevailing
nor’-west winds always cause condensation and the gathering of
cloud-banners about the higher parts of the mountain. ‘Heaven-piercer’
and ‘Cloud-piercer’ are also often used, but are to a certain extent
fancy names.</p></div>

<p>I often look back now with feelings of amusement
at the audacity with which we determined to make our
first attempt to scale the great monarch of the Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Alps, and wonder how we could have been so self-satisfied
with our own powers and confident of our
ability in undertaking such a gigantic task. I can only
suppose that it was ignorance of what lay before us,
and a clear case of ‘fools rush in where angels fear
to tread’; for when my thoughts run back over the
toils, hardships, and bitter lessons of experience undergone
during the past six years, and when I think of the
position of two completely inexperienced men (as far
as <i>true</i> Alpine work is concerned) launching straight
out into such an undertaking, my heart seems to quail
at the idea. It is true that we both had heard and
read of much Alpine work, and had been for some time
in touch with climbing-men, also we were both practised
in hill-walking and accustomed to such work as
mustering sheep, pig-hunting, and shooting over what
in England would be termed rough mountains, so that
as cragsmen we could scarcely be classed as novices.
As to any knowledge other than theoretical of the conditions
of snow and ice, however, we might be termed
tyros, though Fox had done a little scrambling on the
Swiss glaciers. Nevertheless, we had sufficient ‘cheek’
to consider ourselves wise and strong enough to go
straight into a really difficult piece of Alpine work,
and, laughing at all discouragement, we set off for the
mountains.</p>

<p>I have already described the customary route to
the glaciers of Mount Cook, so will not weary my
readers with a long narrative of the journey.</p>

<p>At Timaru (four hours by rail from Christchurch)
we completed our stock of provisions, consisting of
biscuits, tinned meats, &amp;c., and took the evening train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>on to Fairlie Creek (forty miles further inland), where
on arrival we hired a horse and buggy and drove to
Ashwick Station, seven miles distant on the road to the
mountains.</p>

<p>The next day’s journey took us over Burke’s Pass
and into the Mackenzie country, past the beautiful
Lake Tekapo, and on to the ferry situate at the
southern end of Lake Pukaki.</p>

<p>The road itself winds through bleak tussock plains,
interesting only from a geological point of view; but
all monotony of the immediate surroundings is completely
lost when one looks further afield and gazes on
the marvellous beauty of such scenes as the Southern
Alps from Lake Tekapo, or the Ben Ohau Range from
the plains. Even the most fastidious globe-trotter could
not fail to be deeply impressed with such a picture as
Aorangi from Lake Pukaki.</p>

<p>To look at Aorangi from this approach is enough to
damp the spirit of the stoutest Alpine climber that ever
breathed, and is quite sufficient to account for the disbelief
and incredulity cherished in the mind of many
a shepherd in the Mackenzie country regarding the
possibility of ascending the peak.</p>

<p>History repeats itself, and just as we hear of the
native mountaineers of the Himalayas, Andes, and
Caucasus discrediting ascents of glacier peaks around
whose very bases they and their ancestors have lived
and died, so we find that our own countrymen, whose
calling needs their constant presence amongst their
flocks on the lower ranges, refuse to believe that mountains
presenting such an appearance as Aorangi are in
any manner of way to be scaled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>The following day brought us to the Hermitage.
A low mist had hidden the higher peaks throughout
the day, and led to a surprise on the following morning
which I little dreamt of.</p>

<p>I wonder if all Alpine climbers, in first ‘tasting the
sweets of climbing,’ are similarly impressed with their
initial Alpine view!</p>

<p>No words of mine can describe the ecstasy which
seemed to pervade my whole being as on the early,
cloudless morning the wonderful picture of Mount
Sefton reared itself in indescribable sunlit grandeur
above the old bush-clad moraine close by the Hermitage.
Here, indeed, was a new and a fairy-like
world to live in. As we sat in the verandah of the
Hermitage the ice-seamed crags appeared to rise up
and up until they culminated in a long serrated and
corniced ridge, seeming almost to overhang the very
spot where we rested.</p>

<p>A scene of mountain glory never to be forgotten, a
memory to last a lifetime!</p>

<p>More than 8,000 feet above us were built up
those ice-clad precipices, their glaciers glinting in the
bright morning light, their avalanches tearing down the
mountain sides and waking the echoes of a hundred
ravines and valleys with their thunder.</p>

<p>Where is the man who can describe these</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="indent4">palaces of Nature, whose vast walls</div>
      <div class="verse">Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps?</div>
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Where is the mountaineer&mdash;not the mere gymnast, but
the Nature-loving mountaineer&mdash;who can tell the
feelings of such a first impression?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>And yet even this scene seems to fade in the
memory and suffer by contrast with those of other
pictures in the New Zealand Alps, for up the Tasman
Valley, where later on in the day we wended our
way, fresh vistas of Alpine glory were unfolded to
view.</p>

<p>Aorangi from the Hermitage is also a grand sight.
The mountain seems to possess a startling individuality
and a majestic grandeur somewhat different in
character from its worthy neighbour Mount Sefton.
The view is more distant, but the bold outline of the
peak stands out in relief against the blue of the heavens,
and rears a face of glacier-clad precipices to a height of
10,000 feet above the Hooker Valley at the mountain
foot. Light clouds float about the peak and lend an
ethereal air to its beauty, imparting a fairy-like, floating
appearance to the peak itself. At other times the outlines
are apparently clear cut against the sky, giving an
air of lasting and monumental dignity, and conveying
the idea of stability from past ages to ages to come.</p>

<p>After an early lunch, and accompanied by Mr.
Huddleston (the landlord of the Hermitage), and one of
his men, we started off for the Tasman Glacier. The
first part of the way leads down over stony flats to the
termination of the Mount Cook Range, and at this
point the Hooker River is crossed.</p>

<p>On this occasion we double-banked over on horse-back
without much difficulty; but very often the Hooker
River is quite impassable with horses, the torrent being
confined in a narrow boulder bed of about 200 feet
in width, which in flood time, during the warmer months
of spring and summer, is quite filled with a roaring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>torrent, often bearing down with it blocks of ice from
the Mueller and Hooker Glaciers above.</p>

<p>Turning in a north-easterly direction round the end
of the range we shaped our course up the Tasman
Valley, and in two hours’ time from the Hermitage
arrived at the terminal face of the great glacier, which
fills the whole of the valley from side to side, a width
of about two miles. Here, then, the hard work was
about to begin, for the horses could not proceed further,
and it was necessary to carry everything from this
point on our own backs.</p>

<p>Ah! good reader, have you ever carried a swag,
a <i>real</i> swag&mdash;not a Swiss knapsack&mdash;but a real,
torturing, colonial swag? When you take it up and
sling it on your back in the orthodox fashion you
remark: ‘Yes; I think it <i>does</i> weigh fifty pounds.’ In
ten minutes your estimate of its weight has doubled.
In an hour you begin to wonder why Nature has
been so foolish as to make men who will carry swags;
bad language seems to slip out ‘quite in a casual
way,’ and you begin to bend forward and do the ‘lift.’
But the ‘lift’ does not seem to fulfil quite all that is
said in its praise, for soon the torturing burden settles
down again and drags on to your shoulders more
heavily than ever. After a bit of nice balancing over
loose moraine the swag triumphs. Down you go, and
the wretched thing worries you, whilst you bark your
fingers and swear horribly, bruising your knees and
shins, and cursing the day on which you saw the light
of a hard and feelingless world. You recover and repeat
the performance as before, and by the time your day’s
work is done you find out to your own demonstrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>satisfaction that the burden <i>weighs at least five hundred-weight</i>.
You sling it off and give it a malicious kick,
with the result that you break a thermometer or some
such delicate instrument. Then you try to walk, but
stagger about like a drunken man; there is no small to
your back, your back tendons are puffy and tired like
those of an old horse, your head swims, and your eye is
dim. Patience and rest, however, gradually bring you
round, and soon you regain strength and spirits in
feeling that at least you have conquered a day’s
difficulties and have brought your board and lodging
so far with you.</p>

<p>Ah! think of it, you knapsack mountaineers, you
feather-bed Swiss mountaineers, with your tracks, your
hotels, your guides, your porters, and your huts. No;
this New Zealand work is not like yours.</p>

<p>But then, you see, we are enjoying what you cannot
get. Exploring and opening out virgin fields, learning
to be our own guides&mdash;and porters&mdash;from that best of
masters&mdash;hard experience.</p>

<p>We struck up the little valley which here exists
between the lateral moraine on our right and the hill
on our left, and toiled on amidst dense scrub so
gnarled and matted that we could at times walk on
it as on a spring bed, though now and then going
through, of course. The scrub alternated with slopes of
loose strips of moraine. By evening we reached a little
blue lake which feeds the creek issuing from the valley’s
mouth, and here we pitched our tent for the night.</p>

<p>The sub-Alpine vegetation here is interesting and
varied. Wild Irishman (<i lang="mi" xml:lang="mi">te matakuru</i> of the natives or
<em>matagowrie</em> of the shepherds), Spaniards, with leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>like carving-knives and points like needles, having
stalks sometimes eight or ten feet high; stunted totara,
many varieties of veronica, celmisias with large marguerite
daisy-like flowers, the beautiful white ranunculus,
and a hundred bushes and creepers all mixed up in the
most glorious confusion amid rocks sometimes covered
with slippery moss, over and amongst which it is anything
but pleasant to force one’s way. The mountain
sides are clothed almost up to the snow-line with beech,
totara, ribbon-wood, veronica, and other trees, the
rich foliage being beautifully varied; but not having
sufficient time to cut bedding, we spent an uncomfortable
night. The first evening is always the worst in
camp. In the morning we continued our rough journey
up the valley and our struggle with the ‘worrying’
swag.</p>

<p>Soon we discovered traces of fires and old camps,
and we knew we were on the tracks of Green’s and Von
Lendenfeld’s parties. An hour for dinner under a
splendid waterfall, and more toiling onwards, till at last
we were over the last boulder-face from the mountain
on our left, with the Ball Glacier in full view. Fox,
bending down, picked up a portion of an old veil,
shortly after I found a goggle box, then came a tomahawk
lying on a rock, then the historical tent poles of
Mr. Green, and we knew we had reached ‘Green’s
fifth camp.’</p>

<p>Off came the swags, and right glad we were to be
done with them. If a man were only built on the
same lines as a Mount Cook grasshopper he might ‘stand
some show’ in those parts, for these insects are the most
accomplished rock acrobats, jumping twenty or thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>times their own length at a spring, landing on their
heads or anyhow with a bang, and squaring up for the
next jump as coolly as cucumbers.</p>

<p>We found many relics of Green’s and of Von Lendenfeld’s
parties, amongst them a surveyor’s chain,
which, with Green’s tent poles, we have for the last five
seasons used to pitch our tents.</p>

<p>Scarcely were we made snug for the night when
down came a terrific nor’-wester, blowing with fearful
violence, making the tent boom and shake till we
expected it to blow to ribbons. Rain poured down,
thunder, lightning, and avalanches all lent their aid,
and the elements seemed to be having a generally rowdy
time of it. All this, of course, meant snow on the
higher peaks; our spirits fell to zero very quickly, and
we gave up all hope of tackling Aorangi for at least
a day or two.</p>

<p>The nor’-wester is the <em>Föhn</em> wind of New Zealand,
similar in character to the <em>Föhn</em> winds of Switzerland
or the <em>Pampiero</em> of the Andes. Warm air laden with
moisture travels from the equatorial and Australian
waters, till, striking the range of the Southern Alps,
precipitation ensues, the wind descending on to the
eastern plains dry and hot.</p>

<p>Having studied Von Lendenfeld’s map of the Tasman
Glacier and its surrounding peaks made in 1883 we
knew our whereabouts; but as yet we had not seen the
peak of Mount Cook, having been toiling up close under
the eastern flank of the range, which continues from the
peak proper for a distance of ten or twelve miles in a
south-easterly direction.</p>

<p>The morning broke beautifully clear, and we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>early aroused by some inquisitive keas, or mountain
parrots, which perched on the tent and set up an unearthly
screeching. These birds are ridiculously amusing
and tame, and we frequently replenished our larder with
them by the aid of a shanghai, or common schoolboy’s
catapult, with which instrument of warfare I have the
rather questionable credit of being somewhat of an adept.
When I think of the savoury fries and stews which the
shanghai has brought to our camp table&mdash;the table
being usually a rock or a large lily leaf&mdash;I begin to be
reconciled to the haunting regrets for apple-destroying
and window-smashing which so often beguiled the
tedium of a scholastic career.</p>

<p>We determined not to attempt any climbing so
soon after the storm, but set out to reconnoitre the
route taken by Mr. Green.</p>

<p>Mounting the steep lateral moraine of the Ball
Glacier we were soon across it and on to the clear
ice of the Hochstetter stream beyond, and felt the
joyful crunching of our well-nailed boots as we tramped
along over the uneven surface.</p>

<p>There is something exhilarating in this setting foot
on the clear ice after days of clambering over cruel
rocks, something that seems to thrill one as the nails
go ‘crunch, crunch’ and give such grand foothold,
a cheerful ring in the clink of the ice-axes, a peculiar
charm in the tinkle of the little surface streams, a sense
of peace and loveliness in all around, an inspiration of
awe and grandeur in the glorious masses of mountains
which rear their hoary heads for thousands of feet
above, whilst over all there seems to hang an invisible
and imperious over-ruling and omnipotent Power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>directing the marvellous workings of Nature. Here
man may feel his littleness and his unworthiness, and
yet with Byron he feels what is so beautifully expressed
in ‘Childe Harold’&mdash;</p>

<p>The Hochstetter Glacier is one of the most impressive
and beautiful sights in the Southern Alps.
Its supplies come even from the very summits of
Aorangi and Mount Tasman, the two noblest mountains
in Australasia. Avalanches from the eastern and
northern slopes of Aorangi descend to a large ice
plateau situate at an altitude of 8,000 feet. From
between the great north-eastern spur of Aorangi and
the southern slopes of Mount Tasman the Linda Glacier
issues also into this plateau; it was discovered and
named by Mr. Green. From the eastern slopes of
Mount Tasman and the southern flanks of Mount
Haast avalanches also descend to the plateau, which
must be some ten or twelve square miles in area.
This plateau has but one outlet&mdash;the fall of the Hochstetter
Glacier. Viewed from below, the frozen cascade
tumbles in the wildest confusion over a precipice of
4,000 feet to join the Tasman Glacier at an altitude
of 4,000 feet (roughly speaking), and presents a most
wonderful appearance. The fall at the top is probably
about a mile and a half in width, narrowing to one
mile at its foot, and the ice is broken up into <em>séracs</em>,
cubes, pinnacles, and towers of all shapes and sizes,
intersected by crevasses of the divinest bluish-green
colour, and each pinnacle crested with a white cap of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>unconsolidated snow. One enormous rock protrudes
through the ice in its southern and lower portion,
crowned with toppling <em>séracs</em> 200 or 300 feet in
height, which at regular intervals fall over the face
of the rock and descend in magnificent avalanches.
First comes a report like a pistol shot, then follows
an almighty crash accompanied by clouds of snow and
ice dust, succeeded by a low rumbling thunder as the
blocks expend their impetus on the gentler slope below,
and finally settle down again into solid ice, to continue
their journey of centuries towards the terminal face of
the glacier nine miles down the valley. Above the fall
stand out, in bold relief against the clear sky, the giant
forms of Aorangi and Tasman.</p>

<p>To stand before this wonderful piece of Nature’s
work and gaze on the weird and fascinating forms of
the attendant peaks is an experience not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The awful and solemn silence of the mountains,
broken only now and again by the crash and thunder
of an ice avalanche or the screech of a solitary kea,
the complete desolation, the loneliness and remoteness
from the haunts of men, all tend to inspire one with
deep thoughts and feelings. One line in Walter C.
Smith’s ‘Hilda’ expresses more than pages of mine
would do&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">The silence of the mountains spoke unutterable things.</p>

<p>In two hours’ time we were across the glacier and
on the point of the ridge descending from Mount Haast,
which bounds the northern side of the ice-fall. We
began the ascent of the ridge amongst snow-grass and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>lilies, but soon the vegetation gave way to rockwork,
and when a height of about 5,000 feet was attained we
made sure that this was our correct route, and, mist
coming on, we descended again, and reached our Ball
Glacier camp in the evening.</p>

<p>We resolved to make our attempt on the peak
early the following morning, and accordingly, at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
packed our swags, containing ‘tucker’ for three days,
spirit lamp, blanket, opossum rug, mackintoshes, instruments,
a change of warm clothing, &amp;c., intending
that night to find a bivouac at 8,000 feet if
possible.</p>

<p>Starting at 5.20 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we crossed the Ball Glacier in
the very dim light of a waning moon, and were on the
Hochstetter ice at peep of day, and making good time
across, reached the point of the Haast spur in an hour
and three-quarters. A thick mist hung over us, and
we waited for an hour for it to lift, amusing ourselves
by smoking and botanising, and watching the antics of
some queer little wrens. These birds are absurd-looking
little creatures with long legs and longer toes,
plump buff-coloured breasts, no tails, staring little
eyes, and look for all the world like boiled potatoes
with their jackets on, set up on hairpins and let loose
on the rocks.</p>

<p>As the mist cleared we tackled the ascent, and
found it pretty stiff work, although we had snow-grass
to assist us for some way up; but the rocks above this
began to show signs of rottenness, and much care was
required to avoid dislodging them. We made good
progress to about 5,000 feet, when we were quite
baffled for a time, and were forced to leave the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><em>arête</em> and look for a more promising route on our right.
Here we proceeded cautiously, crawling through a
narrow niche in some overhanging rocks with a
precipice of some hundreds of feet below. Then the
climbing improved till our view upwards was bounded
by an indefinite saddle in the rocks, which might
have led to anywhere, but which did lead, as we
subsequently found out, to the easy snow slopes
above.</p>

<p>As the day advanced small falls of stone occurred,
which caused some annoyance and danger, but we
managed to avoid being struck by any. Then followed
another stretch of rotten rock which Fox absolutely
declined to tackle, and as it could not be turned by a
détour we were brought up on this route.</p>

<p>Fox suggested descending again to cross a large
glacier coming down from the ridge on our right, and
trying the rocks on its opposite side. This plan we
eventually carried out, but it was a fatal mistake as
far as climbing Aorangi was concerned. Descending
for about 1,000 feet we stepped on to the ice of what
we then thought was the lower part of the Linda
Glacier&mdash;owing to a strange error in Von Lendenfeld’s
map&mdash;but which in reality was the Freshfield
Glacier. We put on the rope and our goggles, both
indispensable in crossing such a snow-covered ice
stream.</p>

<p>On taking to the rocks on the other side we soon
gained the lowest ice slopes, covered with six or eight
inches of snow in splendid order, and adhering well to
the ice; now and then we took to the rocks, but
climbed mostly by the snow slopes till we reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>crest of the ridge and looked over a precipice to
Mount Haidinger and the Haast Glacier below.</p>

<p>It was now 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and after a short rest, upon my
suggesting a move upwards, Fox said that he did not
fancy the rocks above&mdash;which certainly did look bad&mdash;and
counselled a retreat. Of course I was disappointed,
and reluctant to give up the attempt so soon, yet there
did seem to be no end to the difficulties above, and
experience has since taught me that Fox was wise in
his counsel, for it was indeed simple madness for two
greenhorns to tackle such work.</p>

<p>I soon forgot my troubles in gazing on the scene
which burst upon us as we gained the ridge. Below
lay the major part of the Haast Glacier, descending in
a similar manner to the Hochstetter ice-fall from the
corniced <em>arête</em> of Mount Haidinger, a marvellous mass
of <em>sérac</em> ice. A long rest here, and a resolve to revisit
the locality during the next season with a stronger
party, and we began the descent.</p>

<p>My first experience of glissading on the snow slopes
below was decidedly amusing; but the art is easily
acquired, and after the inevitable spill or two one soon
gets into the way of putting one’s axe directly behind
and not at the side, as is the first impulse. Many
and many a good slide have I enjoyed during the
last six years, and I know no more exhilarating sensation.</p>

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In winter time, on the front ranges, we have sometimes
made glissades of 2,000 to 3,000 feet without a
stop, and on one occasion, in crossing the Mount Cook
Range, Mr. Arthur Harper and I glissaded close on to
4,000 feet with only occasional stoppages for crevasses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>Reaching the bottom of the slopes we made an
examination of the Haast Glacier at its junction with
the Tasman, which disclosed a terribly crevassed stream,
the ice appearing like the leaves of a half-opened book,
the alternating crevasses occupying by far the greater
space. There ensued an aggravating scramble over the
moraine, followed by a weary trudge across the ice of
the Hochstetter, and we reached our camp at the Ball
Glacier by nightfall.</p>

<p>Sleep visited our wearied eyelids that night and had
never seemed so sweet, but the morning broke raining
and stormy, and as it was from the nor’-west and looked
like continuing, we determined to make homewards for
the Hermitage at once.</p>

<p>Then ensued the awful scramble down between the
moraine and the mountain side with those terrible
swags, but, being by this time in good trim, we arrived
at the terminal face of the glacier in four hours and a
quarter, a distance which occupied Mr. Green with
Emil Boss and Ulrich Kaufmann thirteen hours in
coming down in their final retreat.</p>

<p>On reaching the Hooker, we found the river running
strongly and rising fast with the nor’-west rain, but
after some looking about discovered a possible ford
where the river anastomosed into four branches, and
steadying ourselves with our ice-axes, waded through
the torrent. Cold! Cold was no word for it, and the
force of the current was terrible as it rushed over an
uneven and treacherous bed of boulders.</p>

<p>But we got through safely, and soon the Hermitage,
our haven of refuge, was in sight, and we struck up the
shingle flats at a merry pace, reaching our destination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>in seven hours and a quarter from the Ball Glacier
camp.</p>

<p>On returning from the Hermitage we thought, by
crossing the Tasman River and driving down the opposite
bank, to avoid driving round Lake Pukaki, and so
to save thirty miles of travelling. As a rule the river
is not crossable in the summer months, but on this
occasion we were assured of the practicability of getting
over; and leaving the track at Birch Hill Station, we
drove out into the great expanse of shingle which forms
the river-bed.</p>

<p>We had crossed all the streams but the last, and
were within a few yards of the further bank of that,
when our horse, poor old Nipper, sank in a quicksand,
and as soon as the current caught his body we saw it
was all up. The horse and buggy got broadside on to
the current, and quick as thought we jumped for it,
just as the conveyance was turning over for the first
time, Fox down-stream and I up.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew was that I was being washed
into the bottom parts of the buggy, then sideways up,
but struggling out and gaining a footing, the first
impulse was to whip out my pocket-knife and cut the
horse free, and, in my haste, both blades were broken
before a stitch of the harness was cut. Fox, in the
meanwhile, recovered his feet, and was holding Nipper’s
head above water as we all moved gradually down-stream
with the force of the current, the horse and
buggy rolling over and over. With Fox’s knife I was
more successful, and cut the horse free. Fortunately we
were being washed into shallower water on a spit of
shingle, and we were able to wade out with the horse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>after which we returned to extricate the buggy, which
had come to a standstill on its side, and was fast being
silted up with moving shingle. It required all our
strength to free it, and in doing so one of the wheels
‘buckled.’</p>

<p>I have no doubt that we presented an amusing and
half-drowned appearance as we stood on the bank and
called the roll. All that was missing was my mackintosh,
a mat, and whip.</p>

<p>Then we jumped on our buckled wheel till it sprang
back into its normal shape, and splicing up the harness,
wended our way back across the minor streams to the
track at Birch Hill, wetter, sadder, and wiser men.</p>

<p>We reached Pukaki Ferry an hour after dark and
Fairlie Creek the next evening, where we found the
township in a state of jollification over the annual race-meeting.
Most of the New Zealand country townships
boast of their annual race-meeting, the racing lasting
one day, and the whisky part of the proceedings generally
running into three.</p>

<p>Then we took the train for Christchurch.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> the winter following my first essay at Alpine
climbing I was not idle, but made several pig-hunting
excursions amongst the foot-hills in North Canterbury,
in addition to which, with a companion in the shape of
an old friend and schoolfellow, Mr. M. J. Dixon, I made
the ascent of Mounts Torlesse (6,434 feet) and Puketeraki
(5,780 feet) at a time when these mountains were
snow-covered to within 2,000 feet of their respective
bases.</p>

<p>The former ascent was accomplished in the face of
a nor’-west gale, and well I remember how we had
sometimes to lie down on the snow and hold on to our
sticks to avoid being blown clean away. We have
twice since climbed this peak under similar conditions,
and I never remember the wind blowing with such force
as it does on Mount Torlesse.</p>

<p>It was on February 1, 1887, that Messrs. M. J.
Dixon, C. H. Inglis, and myself left Christchurch for a
second try at Aorangi.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>We were now well equipped for the attack, having
obtained 160 feet of Alpine rope, three good ice-axes
from M. Fritz Boss of Grindelwald, and suitable nails
for our boots. Inglis had his camera and two dozen
plates.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Hermitage we found that the
Hooker River was up and quite impassable for horses,
consequently we were forced to cross the Mueller
Glacier by the Hermitage, walk up the Hooker Valley,
and cross the terminal face of that glacier on to the
western slopes of the Mount Cook Range, after which
we worked our way down the river till opposite the
Hermitage again, where a length of fencing wire was
thrown across the torrent by which we were able to
take our swags over.</p>

<p>The roar of the torrent was deafening, and oral
communication across was quite impossible. The wire
on our side was made fast eight or ten feet above the
water, and on the other about twenty feet. Three
cheers were given us by the party of tourists on the
other bank, to which we replied, and then we were cut
off from the haunts of men for a week, and thrown
quite on our own resources for clothing, food, and
shelter&mdash;board and lodging, in fact.</p>

<p>Then came the arranging of swags, adjustment of
carriers, &amp;c., and we soon discovered that we had all
we could carry&mdash;over 50 lbs. each. Then followed the
toiling down the steep bank of the river to reach the
end of the range, in the piping heat and glaring sun,
now and then having to ascend the slopes to avoid the
river, which rushed along close to the rocks.</p>

<p>At one place in particular we experienced some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>difficulty, having to resort to the use of the rope to
climb a ditch or <em>couloir</em> in the rock-face where the
river boiled past at a terrific pace. Here the camera
was accidentally dropped, and falling down fifty feet or
so, lodged on a ledge which overhung the water.
Strange to say, when recovered it was found to be quite
uninjured!</p>

<p>By dint of continued exertion and considerable
expenditure of adipose tissue we at last turned the end
of the range, and upon reaching the first water as we
struck up the Tasman Valley, boiled the ‘billy’ and
made a good lunch.</p>

<p>The wind now began to rise from the nor’-west, and
clouds of dust were sweeping down the valley, so we
lost no time in pressing on to a patch of Irishman
scrub a mile or so below the terminal face of the
glacier. We hurriedly cut some bedding and pitched
the tent before the rain came on, in rather close
proximity to an old creek-bed, which had apparently
been dry for some time.</p>

<p>That creek made up for lost time during the
night, and soon the rain came down in bucketsful as
we lay our wearied limbs to rest in our oiled calico
blanket-bags. The thunder crashed and the lightning
flashed, and the Tasman River began to roar, and by
one o’clock such a quantity of rain had fallen as to
convert the dry creek-bed into a roaring torrent, whose
waters threw up a bank of shingle, and, turning its
course (horror of all horrors!), came right into our
tent. In less than a minute from the time that we felt
the first trickle there was a foot of water in the tent,
and all our impedimenta of every description were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>sopping or floating about in the dark, and in imminent
danger of being washed away.</p>

<p>Hurriedly we collected all we could into our
blanket-bags, got into our boots somehow, and made
for higher ground. We could not see a rise in the
ground, but after wading about found a small portion
out of water, and, with much strong language and
trouble, succeeded in repitching the tent&mdash;after a
fashion.</p>

<p>Ah! well do we remember the miseries and discomforts
of the scene. Wind blowing in fitful gusts,
rain coming down in sheets, while thunder and lightning
and the incessant roar of the Tasman all tended to
make the scene one of terror and discomfort. Matches
nearly all destroyed; bread reduced to a state of pulp;
blankets and clothes wet; instruments, boots, ropes,
ice-axes muddled up anywhere, some in the tent, some
being silted up or washed away from the spot where
the tent was first pitched; the floor of the tent now
hard, wet stones, in lieu of comfortable, dry tussock.
Oh, the misery of it!</p>

<p>We lay in our wet clothes the rest of that night, all
the following day, and the next night. Inglis and I
scarcely stirred but to eat some disgusting, soppy
mixture or to light our pipes; but Dixon pluckily
rigged up a break-wind with an old tent left by the
Birch Hill shepherds, and after three hours’ persistent
labour kindled a fire, improvising a chimney out of
a pair of white flannel trousers and sundry other
garments!</p>

<p>We were quite hemmed in by water, and were in a
constant state of anxiety lest the river should make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>depredations in our direction, as it was quite close to
us, whilst in the creek on the other side we could hear
the rocks being rolled down by the force of water.</p>

<p>Nine inches of rain had fallen during the forty-eight
hours, but on the Sunday it cleared, and once
again the warm sun shone out, the clouds drifted away
from the mountains, the birds began to sing, and the
waters subsided as quickly as they had risen, and our
spirits rose again as we spread out our wet belongings
on the scrub and donned a shirt, hat, and a pair of
boots apiece, and set out for a visit to the scene of
devastation at the face of the glacier whence the river
issues. The costume was airy but convenient, as we
had to cross several streams before reaching our destination.</p>

<p>We were well rewarded for our walk, for a wonderful
sight was presented where the river flows out from
the glacier. For a distance of half a mile from the face
the banks of the main stream were strewn with blocks of
ice of all sizes up to twelve or fifteen feet in thickness.
At one spot the river rushed in mad violence from a
great cavern of ice; in another it rose as from a geyser
from under the ice, sending up a large column of water
to a height of six or eight feet.</p>

<p>It was quite a new sensation to be dry again, but
that night rheumatism screwed my joints, and some
venomous insect bit my shoulder, causing intense pain
for a short time.</p>

<p>While the rain continued we had all thought of
falling back on the Hermitage as soon as we were
able, but a bright sunny morning caused us to change
our plans and forge ahead for the Ball Glacier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>camp, weakened though we were in strength and
supplies.</p>

<p>Already we felt that our chance of ascending
Aorangi was gone, for the snow lay thick on the upper
peaks and avalanches were of common occurrence; yet
we doggedly pushed on, determined not to turn without
a struggle.</p>

<p>Leaping from rock to rock, avoiding the scrub and
Spaniards by sticking to the moraine slopes, and scrambling
over great <em>tali</em> of boulders which came from the
mountain sides, by evening we reached our destination
(the Ball Glacier), and finding the surveyor’s chain,
tent poles, and hatchet&mdash;left by Fox and myself the
previous season&mdash;in good order, we quickly had a
comfortable camp pitched. A small army of mountain
parrots or keas soon assembled, and the unerring
shanghai procured grilled kea for supper.</p>

<p>Next morning broke gloriously fine, and by 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
we were away with blanket-bags, three days’ ‘tucker,’
and a change of warm clothing, intending to reach
Green’s bivouac on the Haast Ridge that evening,
and to make a final dash at Aorangi on the day
following.</p>

<p>Once again we plunged into all those pleasures and
joys of mountaineering. Again we felt the clear ice of
the beautiful Hochstetter Glacier crunch under our iron-shod
feet. Now we were away from all the hum-drum
cares of life, from the misery of flooded camps, in the
free mountain air, with the stupendous ice-falls and the
majestic peaks all around. We seemed to breathe a
heavenly atmosphere, to live a new life in another and
a better world. Where is the man who can come into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>contact with these surroundings and not be better in
body and soul?</p>

<p>We reached the foot of the Haast Ridge by 9.30,
and here we debated as to whether we should tackle
Aorangi after all, or try De la Bêche, further up the
glacier (which peak would be an easier ascent and
command a magnificent view of both eastern and
western glacier systems). Aorangi it was, however,
we had come to tackle, and so, again shouldering our
swags, we went at the ridge.</p>

<p>We kept to the crest of the spur and found the
climbing very simple, for a thousand feet amongst lilies
and snow-grass; but after that the real business
amongst rotten and precipitous rock ridges and faces
commenced, and we had to put on the rope. At this
time none of us were very proficient in the use of the
rope, but we soon began to value the assistance it
affords and to appreciate the assurance it inspires.</p>

<p>It was not until 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> that we reached the top of
the ridge, where we soon discovered Green’s bivouac,
not far from which spot we determined to spend the
night.</p>

<p>All the way up we had been climbing with the
Hochstetter ice-fall on our left, and had been favoured
with the grandest views of Aorangi, which looked
absolutely impregnable; but as our view of the Linda
Glacier and the Great Plateau was shut off by the
upper part of the Haast Ridge, we could not see the
route which we were bent on following.</p>

<p>Here I may remark that the route by which
Mr. Green, and subsequently Dixon and myself
climbed the mountain cannot be seen from any distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>point. I refer, of course, to the upper part of the
route above the Haast Ridge. Even the plateau is so
shut in as to be invisible from any distant point, except
from the peaks of the Malte Brun Range on the opposite
side of the valley.</p>

<p>Scraping away all the larger stones from under an
overhanging rock and building a semicircular break-wind,
we dug holes for our hips (one gets very sore
in hard beds of this nature if such a precaution
be neglected), wriggled into our blanket-bags, boiled
a pannikin of Liebig, and slept like tops till the
morning.</p>

<p>The rosy fingers of the morn had just opened the
gates of day as our heads emerged from the apertures
of our bags, and showed one of the most magnificent
panoramas of Alpine wonder which it has been my lot
to view.</p>

<p>Three thousand feet below us lay the Tasman Glacier
with its marvellous stream of pure ice, on our right the
Hochstetter ice-fall, on which we could look down and
view with wonder its chaos of <em>séracs</em> and crevasses, the
ice-clad precipices of Aorangi rising heavenwards from
it in bold ruggedness. Down the valley to the south-west
the grey moraine, with the meandering river still
further afield. Across the valley the rocky peaks of
the Liebig and Malte Brun Ranges with their hanging
glaciers, and right opposite to us Malte Brun himself, a
pyramid of red rock, flanked by ice and snow slopes,
standing out clearly against the morning sky like a
great grim castle, and looking quite safe from any
assault of man&mdash;on this side at all events. Following
round the panorama to the northwards, Mount Darwin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>sends its one great glacier sweeping down into the main
stream; then the Hochstetter Dome stands at the head
of the Tasman Glacier itself, and westward rise the
noble summits of Mounts Elie de Beaumont, Green, and
De la Bêche&mdash;the last a most beautiful triple peak,
queen of the whole group, and over 10,000 feet in
height. Still following round, the eye falls on the
Rudolf Glacier descending from the peak of the same
name, then Mounts Jervois, Spencer, Glacier Peak, and
lastly Mount Haidinger, a fine flat-topped mountain
clothed from base to summit in broken ice.</p>

<p>Behind us lay Mount Tasman (11,475 feet), invisible
over the higher parts of the spur on which we were
now situated. From our coign of vantage we counted
twenty-five tributary glaciers of the Tasman, some with
ice-falls, others joining with graceful curve.</p>

<p>We congratulated ourselves that all our weary toil
and hard swagging had not been fruitless, and felt quite
compensated for the miseries we had gone through at
the lower camp, though the main object of our visit, we
feared, was about to be defeated in a very short time.
We pulled ourselves together, put on the rope, and
resolved to make some pretence of a fight for it.</p>

<p>After an hour’s work we reached the highest rocks,
then there came a dip on to a snow saddle, beyond
which, again, snow slopes lead on to the final summit of
the spur which hid the Great Plateau.</p>

<p>But it was not to be; for whenever we went on to
snow we sank waist-deep, and struggled in vain to make
any headway. Here, then, we were beaten, and planting
our Christ’s College flag in the highest rocks, gave it
three cheers for the old school days, and depositing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>bottle with the record of our ascent, turned our backs
on the grim giant Aorangi, and began to go down.</p>

<p>We struck a better route down by going into some
<em>couloirs</em> north of the <em>arête</em> of the spur, and reached the
Ball Glacier camp again, going down the following day
to the Hermitage, after crossing the Hooker by the kind
assistance of a shepherd from Birch Hill. The Hooker
River had risen to such an extent during the rain storm
as to carry away the wire on which we had slung our
swags across. The camera was warped with the wet
at the lower camp, whilst the plates were anything
but ‘dry’ after the storm, so photography was altogether
a failure in this excursion.</p>

<p>In the winter time we amused ourselves with
another ascent of Mount Torlesse.</p>

<small>THIRD ATTEMPT TO CLIMB AORANGI</small></h2>

De la Bêche</i></p>


<p class="center">Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends.&mdash;<em>Childe Harold.</em></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a thousand pities that the ennobling pursuit of
mountaineering is so neglected in this wonderland of
peaks and glaciers. Such advantages as we enjoy
surely cannot exist much longer without calling out the
spirit which lies dormant in hundreds of the lovers of
adventure and worshippers of the beautiful in Nature,
who live on in our midst from day to day in a conventional
and monotonous round.</p>

<p>There are pleasures in the pursuit of adventure
amongst the great snow-fields and glaciers which only
those who are initiated can thoroughly enjoy.</p>

<p>Ask the man who goes climbing what these pleasures
are, and he cannot tell you, he cannot define them&mdash;yet
he feels them, and they are ever luring him on. They
are indefinite, inexpressible; but there is a sort of
‘mountain fever’ which comes when one has once ‘lost
one’s heart to the great mountains.’ In the work all a
man’s best physical, and many of his mental, powers are
brought out and strengthened. There is the energy,
perseverance, and patience to last through a long day’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>swagging, the pluck to face all sorts of dangers amongst
the snow, ice, and rocks, combined with the prudence
to know when, for the safety of oneself and the party,
to give in and restrain enthusiasm. There are the
qualities of organisation and system, for which plenty of
exercise is found; indeed, one cannot overrate the
benefits which accrue.</p>

<p>Let any who have indulged in different branches of
athletics put their swags on their backs and go for a
mountain climb, and I venture to say that there are
greater opportunities for bringing their frames into good
going order and testing their muscular abilities than
can be met with in any school of athletics.</p>

<p>I have known men in England who have revelled in
all our great national games, but who invariably put
mountaineering at the head of the list after once having
tasted the sweets of climbing and been captivated by
the charms of the world above the snow-line.</p>

<p>To the artistic what do not the mountains offer? To
the botanist, the geologist, the naturalist, the athlete,
and even to the invalid? The strange new world one
enters in sub-Alpine regions, the ‘foretaste of heaven’
one seems to get above the snow-line.</p>

<p>In out-of-the-way New Zealand we have all these
benefits at hand, and yet we leave the opening out and
exploration of our great glacier systems to foreigners
and to visitors from distant lands.</p>

<p>But this is digressive, and I must tell the story of
our third visit to the Tasman Glacier.</p>

<p>On the evening of March 23, 1889, the visitors at
the Hermitage were suddenly moved to compassion,
mingled with no small amount of amusement, in behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ing
through the fast-falling snow-flakes the arrival of a
dog-cart and tandem.</p>

<p>The leader of the team, a big chestnut draught-mare,
seemed to be doing all the work, and pulling along
wheeler, cart and all. The travel-worn and weary
occupants of the vehicle were Mr. M. J. Dixon and
myself, and we had taken French leave for Mr.
Huddleston’s chestnut at Birch Hill, six miles down
the road from the Hermitage, our leader having almost
given in after a 250-mile journey from Christchurch.</p>

<p>Another bold, would-be mountaineer, Mr. P. H.
Johnson, accompanied us with the knocked-up leader,
and following in the coach was Mr. F. Cooper, a photographic
operator from Messrs. Wheeler and Son of
Christchurch, who was to join our party for a week’s
work amongst the scenes of the Tasman Glacier.</p>

<p>The morning of the 24th revealed the flats around
the Hermitage all snow-covered, and the day was
devoted to completing preparations for a fortnight’s
camp on the glacier.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the weather improving, our party left
the Hermitage, being joined by James Annan and
William Low, the former a boundary keeper on the
rabbit fence, the latter engaged to help us with the
swagging. Two better men over rough ground never
put swag on back, and both entered into the spirit of
the expedition and worked like Trojans to make it a
success.</p>

<p>We drove our dog-cart down to the Hooker River at
the usual crossing-place&mdash;the point of the Mount Cook
Range&mdash;over two or three miles of boulders which
tested the merits of the coachbuilder’s art to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>utmost, as also the driver’s ability to stay in the cart.
Here we found that a wire rope, some 200 feet in
length, had been thrown across the river to facilitate
the work of the rabbiters, who were engaged in keeping
back the hordes of ‘silver-greys’ which were making
their way northwards and ruining run-holders right and
left. On this wire rope is slung, on runners, a rude
box, travellers entering the same pull themselves across,
and almost invariably take the skin off their knuckles
with the runners. Crossing by this rope we piled our
swags on to Annan’s packhorse and walked three miles
up the valley to a patch of Wild Irishman scrub, where
since our last visit a small galvanised iron hut had
been built. A day’s delay here with bad weather,
and then we shouldered our swags, and on the evening
of the 27th reached our well-known Ball Glacier
camp.</p>

<p>Our plans were as follows: To do a few days’ work
with the photographer, so as to settle his business first,
and then be free to tackle Aorangi during the following
week. We wished to give the photographer every
assistance in our power, as such scenery does not often
come within reach of the photographic artist, however
energetic he may be, and can only be approached
by a properly equipped Alpine party, strong enough
to carry a good supply of provisions and all the
necessaries for preserving life in such out-of-the-way
parts.</p>

<p>Our first excursion, then, was to cross the Tasman
Glacier and make for the point of the Malte Brun Range
at the turn in the glacier just opposite the point of De
la Bêche. Here it was that Dr. von Lendenfeld had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>made his bivouac for his remarkable ascent of the
Hochstetter Dome in 1883, when he was accompanied
by his wife and one porter&mdash;an ascent that took twenty-seven
hours of constant ice and snow work. This excursion
would effect the double purpose of giving us
some practice in ice work, and of securing a fine set of
views.</p>

<p>The day was gloriously fine, and we felt our spirits
rise as we scrambled over the massive lateral moraine
of the Ball Glacier, across the glacier itself&mdash;which,
by-the-by, shows very dirty ice at this point, being
laden with rocks brought down many years since in
the avalanches from the great ice-seamed crags of
Aorangi, which towered in lofty grandeur above us&mdash;then
over the medial moraine between the Ball and
Hochstetter Glaciers, where a halt was made, and
views of Aorangi and the Hochstetter ice-fall were
secured.</p>

<p>Once more we stood before this marvellous piece of
Nature’s handiwork, again we heard the thunder of
the avalanches, again we saw the glinting, bristling
<em>séracs</em>, and gazed in silence and admiration on the ice-fall
of the Hochstetter.</p>

<p>Crossing the Hochstetter we struck up the medial
moraine between that and the Tasman, straight for the
point of De la Bêche.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_046fp.jpg" id="i_046fp.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_046fp.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="494" />
<div class="caption">
    <p class="center"><span class="smaller">MOUNT COOK AND THE HERMITAGE</span></p>
    <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The best walking on the New Zealand glaciers is
almost invariably found upon the margin of the medial
moraine close to where it joins the clear ice, so that
one is travelling over a mixture of ice and rocks. The
clear ice is too hummocky and entails much undulating
progression, if I may use such an expression, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>the moraine itself&mdash;well, the walking on the moraine
itself cannot be fitly described in parliamentary language.</p>

<p>We secured many good views as we proceeded
with a 10 × 8 camera. Mount Haidinger on our left
was particularly fine, its eastern face being almost
entirely clothed with the Haast Glacier, which struck
us as being one of the finest cascades of ice we had yet
seen, larger in extent than the ice-fall of the Hochstetter,
though not so picturesque.</p>

<p>Time was fast going, and we found that to get off
the glacier before dark it would be requisite to strike
away to our right, over a mile of much crevassed ice,
to the gully next in the Malte Brun Range, which we
had originally set out to reach. Jumping crevasses
and cutting a few occasional steps, we at last arrived
at the eastern side, finding a very suitable place to
pitch our Whymper tent, and discovering to our joy a
small supply of firewood.</p>

<p>The gully in which we camped had its origin far
away up in the red-sandstone precipices of Malte Brun,
and in its bed rushed down a foaming mountain torrent
fed everlastingly by the many small hanging glaciers
above. This stream rushed headlong into a large
tunnel of ice in the side of the Tasman Glacier, over
which was formed a tremendous cave, above which,
again, were sheer walls of ice capped with morainic
accumulations, the height from tunnel mouth to moraine
summits being about 500 feet.</p>

<p>A view of this cave was secured by the photographer.</p>

<p>Friday the 29th was a morning to be remembered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Thick mists covered the peaks and seemed to hang
over us like a pall. Here and there a shaft of sunlight
penetrated to the ice-field at our feet. Only now
and then would the rude screech of a kea remind us
that we were not really dreaming in some enchanted
land.</p>

<p>We had often talked of attempting the ascent of
Mount De la Bêche when we should have polished off
Aorangi; but as Aorangi seemed to require so much
‘polishing off,’ and we were now camped so close to
De la Bêche, we thought we might as well try our hand
at the mountain and see what we could do in a one-day’s
trip from this point, while we left the artist to his
own devices for the time being.</p>

<p>De la Bêche, then, it was to be. So off we started
after a breakfast of sheep’s tongues and Liebig, putting
our oilskins on our backs and taking our axes, and
striking due north for the foot of the long <em>arête</em> which
descends from the mountain and separates the Rudolf
from the Tasman Glacier. Halfway to our ridge we
had to put on the rope, for legs began to go through
the now snow-covered crevasses in a promiscuous and
unpleasant fashion.</p>

<p>It was indeed like an enchanted land, for the atmospheric
effects were extraordinary. High up, shadowed
in the mist, were reproduced the forms of the highest
peaks of Mounts Malte Brun and Darwin. There was
no mistaking their familiar outline, which was thrown
out in the mist thousands of feet above, like the spectre
on the Brocken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
  <p class="center"><span class="smaller">CROSSING THE HOOKER RIVER</span></p>
  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then the atmospheric effect of the mist hanging
over the Rudolf Glacier was most wonderful. Looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>up the glacier, we seemed to gaze into an enormous
blue grotto, the sides being the slopes of the main chain
with all its broken glaciers, and the western slopes of
De la Bêche, whilst the overhanging mist furnished
the roof or ceiling. A soft, warm, blue colour pervaded
the whole, beautiful beyond expression.</p>

<p>Arriving at the foot of our mountain we commenced
the ascent, finding the snow of the ice slopes in a loose
and powdery condition, and having to exercise much
judgment to avoid precipitating avalanches in the
steeper pinches.</p>

<p>We climbed without the rope, rapidly, and alternately
in snow and rocks, finding the latter very good&mdash;mostly
of a red sandstone on which the nails of our
boots took good hold. Looking now and then at the
aneroid, we began to feel confident of making the
ascent and returning to our camp by nightfall. But
it was not to be, for, at an altitude of 8,100 feet, we
were brought up by a very bad <em>bergschrund</em> and ridge
of rocks succeeding it.</p>

<p>To the unlearned in Alpine parlance perhaps an
explanation of the nature of a <em>bergschrund</em> is necessary.
At the upper termination of nearly all highly situated
ice slopes there almost invariably occurs between
the rocks above, or between the ice slope and
the permanent clinging ice above, a large gap or
crevasse, partially filled or bridged with new snow
during the winter months, but more open as the warmth
of spring and summer causes the snow to melt and the
ice to shrink away.</p>

<p>This crevasse or gap is called a <em>bergschrund</em>, and
occasionally one may find in it places where the ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>nearly or quite touches the rocks or ice of the upper
side, or sometimes a sound snow bridge may be discovered.
These bridges afford the only means of
crossing wide <em>bergschrunds</em>. At the place in question
a sharp ridge of ice, the lower lip of the <em>bergschrund</em>,
led on to a frail snow bridge with a dip of some six
feet or so in the centre, over a bottomless abyss some
fifteen feet wide.</p>

<p>Dixon cut steps along the ice ridge, having first to
remove a foot of fresh snow from the surface, and then
we walked this novel tight rope, the <em>bergschrund</em> on our
left and steep ice slopes on our right, and crossed the
bridge in safety to a small ledge of ice where there
was only just room for three to stand. Could we proceed?
The rocks above were very bad and ice-coated.
I went at them, clearing the inch or so of ice to get my
fingers into chinks in the rock, and ‘squirming’ up on
my stomach, clinging with toes and fingers, and feeling
disposed to hang on by my teeth or even by the proverbial
eyelids, reached, fifty feet above, the crest of the ridge.</p>

<p>I had been in some queer places in the mountains,
but, pardon the use of a colonial expression, this one
decidedly ‘took the cake,’ and I shall never forget the
start I received when I found myself looking over a
sheer upright face of rock on to an unnamed tributary
glacier of the Rudolf, 1,000, perhaps 2,000, feet below.
I dared not stand up and could scarcely crawl, but lay
full length on the steep eastern slope looking over the
sharp ridge down the western precipice. On the right,
the razor-like <em>arête</em> of rock continued upwards, and
seemed almost, if not quite, inaccessible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center"><span class="smaller">AORANGI FROM THE BALL GLACIER</span></p>
  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Then there was a long-range discussion between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Dixon and Johnson on the ledge below and myself on
the ridge, ending in a decision to descend.</p>

<p>I never to this day can imagine how I came down
that fifty feet of rocks without slipping into the crevasse
below, but, by the aid of Dixon’s directions, I managed
to find chinks in the rock-face for the toes of my boots,
and reached the ledge to breathe the air of relief once
more.</p>

<p>Here we held a council of war. We might, by a
traverse of the ice ridge below, gain the rocks again
above this bad place; but the summit was yet 2,000 feet
above us, the cold so intense that the steel of one’s axe
would adhere to the hand, the time was fast going, and
the photographer and our men would be much concerned
if we stayed out another night, besides which
we were short of provisions, our original intention
having been to stay out but one night. We decided
to acknowledge ourselves beaten for the time being and
to return to camp.</p>

<p>It goes against the grain with Dixon and me to
turn back beaten from a peak. Indeed De la Bêche
and Aorangi are the only ones to which we have
lowered the colours of our grand old school&mdash;Christ’s
College Grammar School, of Christchurch, New Zealand&mdash;and
the latter we have since revenged ourselves upon.
The former will not run away, and we are nursing
a vindictive feeling against this noble triple-topped
summit.</p>

<p>Descending very rapidly, glissading now and then
in safe places, we reached the foot and struck over the
Tasman Glacier again for our camp on the Malte Brun.</p>

<p>Well for us that we had turned from De la Bêche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>for an hour from camp, Dixon, who had been complaining
of not feeling up to the mark for some days and had
been lagging&mdash;an unusual thing for him&mdash;was suddenly
seized with violent cramp in the stomach and thighs.
We thought at the time it was only temporary, consequent
upon great physical exertion and drinking too
much snow-water; but unfortunately he did not seem
able to shake it off, and we had some difficulty in
reaching camp over the maze of crevasses which occur
in the glacier just where our Malte Brun Creek enters.</p>

<p>Here was a nice state of affairs. One of our best
men gone wrong. How about Aorangi next week?</p>

<p>Saturday morning found us ‘tuckerless’ and hungry,
and Dixon worse rather than better.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we struck camp and started for the Ball
Glacier&mdash;really only four hours distant. Whilst taking
some views an hour from camp we suddenly heard
shouts down the glacier, and found that it was our
trusty men, Annan and Low, who, being concerned
about our lengthened absence from the lower camp,
had come out to look for us.</p>

<p>Johnson, Low, and Annan took the bulk of the
swags and started independently for the Ball Glacier,
whilst I stayed to follow at a more leisurely pace with
Dixon and the photographer. Dixon could only walk
for a few minutes at a time and required to rest very
frequently, so I sent Cooper on alone, not dreaming
for a moment that he could go wrong in such simple
ground, where no crevasses to speak of occurred.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_052fp.jpg" id="i_052fp.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_052fp.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="483" />
<div class="caption">
  <p class="center"><span class="smaller">ICE CAVE, TASMAN GLACIER</span></p>
  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> ere we arrived at the head-quarters
after a gallant struggle on Dixon’s part. These are the
times which test a man’s capabilities, these are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>trials of endurance to which the unfortunate who
chances to be taken ill in these Alpine regions is subjected,
and it was a great relief to all to see the afflicted
one struggle bravely into camp.</p>

<p>But a new trouble arose. There was no photographer,
and he ought to have turned up long ago.
Johnson set out to look for him, and after an absence
of an hour I was just putting up a swag of mackintoshes,
provisions, &amp;c., prepared to spend the night photographer-hunting
on the glacier, when Johnson’s figure
appeared against the sky on the crest of the lateral
moraine, shortly followed by that of the missing man,
who had wandered down past the camp instead of
turning off at the right place. Low and Annan had
gone down the valley, and were to come up next day
with more provisions.</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday, we decided to have a
day’s well-earned rest. Messrs. Brodrick and Sladden,
of the Survey Department, came up with Annan and
Low to dinner, bearing with them medical comforts for
the use of our invalid.</p>

<p>As there were still some dry plates left unexposed,
Cooper and I went out about 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and climbed to
a height of 1,000 feet above the camp, on the Ball
Glacier spur, from whence we secured a panoramic
view on four plates of the glacier and the mountains
opposite.</p>

<p>From this point, seeing Aorangi looking so grand,
we pushed on up the ridge, intending to secure an
exposure from a high altitude. Upwards we climbed,
and the further we went the more I was lured on
towards the main southern ridge of the mountain. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>even conceived the idea of making a pass over to the
Hermitage <em>viâ</em> the Hooker Glacier. But the work
became more difficult, and we got into patches of snow
and were unfortunately without our ice-axes. This
made our progress more slow and cautious. Still we
pushed forward, the scene becoming grander at every
step.</p>

<p>At length the light began to fade, and I saw that to
get an exposure of the peak from the main ridge was
hopeless, so Cooper unlimbered his instrument and I
pushed on alone, determined to reach the saddle, at
least, and see over to the other side. Reaching the
final snow&mdash;that covering the actual head of the Ball
Glacier, which had been below us on our right all the
day&mdash;I sped across it as fast as I could go, and keeping
a sharp look out for indentations indicating covered
crevasses, reached the rocks of a peak situate a little
south of the saddle of the Ball Glacier. Crawling over
a snow bridge spanning the <em>bergschrund</em>, which crumbled
uncomfortably under me as I laid hold of the rocks on
the upper side, after a short scramble I attained the
summit.</p>

<p>How shall I tell of the view southwards which met
my astonished gaze? How describe the glorious sunset
effects? Life is not long enough to attempt it.</p>

<p>I was on the nameless peak south of the Ball Glacier
saddle at an altitude of 7,540 feet&mdash;the highest peak
south of the great majestic mass of Aorangi himself,
who towered up for another 5,000 feet above me.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>I quote from Mr. Green to give some idea of what
he thought of our mountains from this point:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Deep down below us lay the Hooker Glacier, reminding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>us of the downward view from the <em>arête</em> of the
Finsteraarhorn, while beyond, the glacier-seamed crags
of Mount Sefton towered skywards.</p>

<p>‘Further off lay the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mer de glace</i> of the Mueller
Glacier, a splendid field of white ice, its lower moraine-covered
termination lost in the blue depths of the
valley at our feet. The high ridge connecting Mount
Sefton with Mount Stokes alone prevented us from
seeing the western sea. It was a glorious day, scarcely
a breath of air stirring; no cloud visible in the whole
vault of blue; ranges upon ranges of peaks in all
directions and of every form, from the iced-capped
dome to the splintered <em>aiguille</em>. It was a wonderful
sight, those lovely peaks standing up out of the purple
haze; and then to think that not one had been climbed!
Here was work, not for a short holiday ramble merely,
not to be accomplished even in a lifetime, but work
for a whole company of climbers, which would occupy
them for half a century of summers, and still there
would remain many a new route to be tried. Here,
then, we stood upon the shoulder of the monarch of
the whole mountain world around us, within less than
5,000 feet of his icy crown, but a long, jagged, ice-seamed
ridge lay in our path. Was it accessible?
Let us see!’</p>

<p>It was not accessible, as anyone who has read Mr.
Green’s interesting book will know, and I could see
from my standpoint very plainly that Mr. Green, with
Emil Boss and Ulrich Kaufmann&mdash;two of the finest
mountaineers in the world&mdash;could not do otherwise
than accept a defeat.</p>

<p>Just such a scene as Mr. Green describes I saw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>only that its mystic beauty was intensified by the soft
glow of evening as the sun sank lower and lower, at
last dipping behind a bank of crimson clouds hanging
over a saddle to the westward.</p>

<p>I seemed spellbound and almost riveted to the
spot, and could only tear myself away when I realised
the awkward position of the photographer and myself,
trapped, as it were, by the fast-closing darkness, 4,000
feet above our camp, with all sorts of climbing difficulties
below. Clambering down the rocks and jumping
the <em>bergschrund</em>, away I sped over the névé slopes,
and reaching Cooper after an hour’s absence, found
him just packing up his camera.</p>

<p>It is too long a story to tell of all our troubles
and adventures in getting down the mountain in the
dark; letting ourselves down on to the rocks, scraping
our hands on sharp edges, plunging knee-deep in soft
snow, following false ridges terminating in precipices
down to the Ball Glacier below, retracing our
erring steps, and at last coming to vegetation again;
then going down off the ridge towards the Tasman,
trying to hit the head of a long shingle slip I was
acquainted with, hearing 2,000 feet above the camp
the first ‘cooee’ from our anxious mates below, and
getting down eventually at half-past ten, ravenous, and
almost torn to pieces by the sharp rocks, Spaniards,
and scrub.</p>

<p>Johnson&mdash;always self-denying and considerate for
others&mdash;was out photographer-hunting again, having
gone on to the Ball Glacier and shouted himself hoarse;
he arrived back in camp at 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> (having been
guided home by a fire which I had kept going on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>moraine since our return), after having experienced
a fruitless hunt of eight hours over rough rocks and
ice. This finished the photography, and on the following
day Cooper and Low went down to the Hermitage.
A finer week for securing negatives could not have
been wished for, and the thirty exposures resulted in
the best set of mountain views yet obtained in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>Now ensued a few days’ rest, Dixon, Johnson, and I
being left in camp with a week’s provisions and designs
on Aorangi, when Dixon should have recovered his
strength.</p>

<p>Only one short excursion did Johnson and I make,
to see if it were possible to reach the Great Plateau
from the eastern buttress of the mountain, and so
save crossing the Hochstetter Glacier and climbing the
Haast Ridge beyond. Our endeavours were fruitless,
for at a height of some 6,300 feet we were brought up
by a high wall of rock. I still think, nevertheless,
that the plateau could be reached in this manner when
a good deal of snow fills the rocky <em>couloirs</em> or ditches
which in places descend in this wall of rock. Should
this be so, it will no doubt prove to be the route of the
future for reaching the Linda Glacier and Aorangi.</p>

<p>The rock-climbing here, however, is very dangerous,
as the frost has split the rocks up in all directions.
One small stone thrown down from above sufficed to
start many tons of loose matter in the <em>couloirs</em>, which
rattled down to the glacier below, sending up clouds
of dust in its descent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="6">VI</abbr><br />
<small>THE ASCENT OF THE HOCHSTETTER DOME</small></h2>

<p class="center1"><i>Camp under De la Bêche&mdash;Twelve Hours on Snow and Ice&mdash;The
Pangs of Hunger</i></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, April 4, was a memorable day, for Annan
coming up from the Hermitage with a further supply
of the ever-welcome ‘tucker,’ we started on one of the
finest mountain expeditions I have seen in our New
Zealand mountains.</p>

<p>It was not part of our original plan to ascend the
Dome; we merely intended to reach the Lendenfeld Saddle
and get a glimpse of the opposite coast and the western
ocean, and it was with this object in view that Johnson,
Annan, and I shouldered our swags and tramped
off to the foot of De la Bêche, which was made in three
hours’ hard walking.</p>

<p>Here we camped in a snug hollow between the
lateral moraines of the Tasman and Rudolf Glaciers.
Small shingle composed our bed, and a snow patch
close by provided us with water, which we boiled in
our ‘Aurora’ stove, as no firewood was to be found so
far up the glacier.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center"><span class="smaller">PEAKS ON MALTE BRUN</span></p>
  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>A fine Friday morning found us at a quarter to
seven on the rope, and making hard work of it amongst
the crevasses of the Tasman Glacier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>I remember well how we resorted to all sorts of
dodges to get over the difficulties, taking the snow
slopes of the mountain sides here, cutting a few steps
there, even going to the length of climbing down into
crevasses and crawling under ice blocks. But eventually
we passed the worst of the crevasses, and made
good time over the smooth, snow-covered surface of the
glacier.</p>

<p>The distance from our De la Bêche camp to the
saddle must be about six or seven miles, but in the
soft and treacherous snow it seemed more like sixty
or seventy.</p>

<p>The glare was something dreadful, and soon our
faces and hands were of the peculiar chocolate colour
which invariably comes under such circumstances. We
could not bear the goggles off for an instant. Gradually
we rose as we plodded away, now and then stepping
over an open crevasse or making a détour to find
snow bridges. There are but few crevasses, however,
for several miles, only when in the proximity of the
saddle where the gradient increases they once more
begin to occur.</p>

<p>On either hand fresh beauties opened out; De la
Bêche on our left presenting the most wonderful face
of <em>sérac</em> ice, streaked here and there with avalanche
slopes, whilst on the right Mount Malte Brun&mdash;the
Matterhorn of New Zealand&mdash;reared his great red
precipices heavenwards, and further on the Darwin
Glacier and Mount Darwin showed in a glorious light
their magic splendour.</p>

<p>Now on our left we passed Mount Green, a fine
precipitous cone of rocks and ice, and then we rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>faster and faster as we edged on to the slopes of the
great Hochstetter Dome on our right, whilst opposite,
Mount Elie de Beaumont showered down his ice streams
to join the Tasman.</p>

<p>Taking turns at leading, at last we came to what
looked like the final rise. An exclamation broke from
Johnson as he espied the new moon appear over the
saddle ahead. It was a small matter, but it seemed to
revive our failing energy and to call us on to victory to
see the silver crescent apparently awaiting us on the
snow ridge. Then a distant peak appeared&mdash;a wild
cheer broke from us; another peak, and yet one more,
followed by groups of twos and threes, dozens, hundreds&mdash;glaciers!
forest! a river! the sea! the boundless
ocean! ‘Hurrah!’ we shouted, ‘our tramp has not
been in vain.’</p>

<p>Here we were in the heart of Nature’s solitudes,
where only once before the foot of man had trodden the
eternal snows.</p>

<p>We spent forty-five minutes refreshing the inner
man and drinking in the glorious view, consulting
maps, and reading the aneroid. The saddle was 8,600
feet high; the Dome was but 9,315 feet. Should we
try it? Yes, we would.</p>

<p>At it we went, cutting many steps and crossing
several awkward <em>bergschrunds</em>, until we reached a level
plateau. Crossing this field we attacked the final slopes.
It was terrific work, and the last pinch required 280
steps, all cut with the spike of the axe and deeply
graven, as a slip in such a place would probably have
meant the loss of the entire party in one of the crevasses
in the slope below.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>My hands were blistered with the axe work, but at
3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we were able to walk on the fast rounding-off
slopes without steps, and soon we were on the summit,
happy and flushed with victory. The mountain has a
double top and we were on the western and slightly
lower one.</p>

<p>What shall I say of the view from the Hochstetter
Dome? It is comprehensive and wonderful. The
whole country lay like a map before us. Westwards
Elie de Beaumont and the western ocean, at our feet the
Whymper Glacier, from which flowed the Wataroa River,
threading its way through forest-and glacier-clad mountains
to the sea, twenty miles away. Northwards and
eastwards extended in glorious and shining array the
magnificent chain of the Alps; glacier upon glacier,
peak upon peak, range upon range of splendid mountains.
Eastwards a fine rocky peak without a name
and Mount Darwin, and looking south-westwards down
the Tasman Glacier, from whence we had toiled our
laborious way, the eye could follow the course of
the great ice stream for twelve or thirteen miles,
flanked by the grand mountains which sent down
their tributary ice streams to join the mass in the valley
below.</p>

<p>We gave three hearty cheers for her Majesty, and
three for our proud little colony, and commenced the
descent, going down backwards in the steps, and taking
firm hold with our axes at every movement.</p>

<p>Time was precious, and on leaving the steps we ran
down most of the less crevassed slopes, and soon found
ourselves at the foot of the conquered mountain. Away
we plodded down the glacier again&mdash;a hard, monotonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>grind&mdash;till we arrived in the failing light at the system
of crevasses on the outside of the turn of the glacier,
close to our camp of the previous night.</p>

<p>This time we kept further out from the edge; but it
was six of one and half a dozen of the other, for soon
we were completely entrapped in a perfect maze of
transverse and longitudinal crevasses, over which the
only mode of progression was continued jumping.</p>

<p>This work in the dusk was anything but pleasant,
yet had to be accomplished, and thanks to the aid
of the rope, after leaping hundreds of them, we
at length found our way off the side of the glacier to
our tent.</p>

<p>How we watched the slowly warming ‘billy’ with
eager eyes, and drank in fancy over and over again the
pannikin of hot Liebig. How we shut the wind out and
nursed the stinking kerosene stove! Alas for our
hopes and our hungry stomachs, the lamp went wrong
somehow, and the oil flowing over, the tent was on the
verge of catching fire when Annan gave the whole
concern a kick which sent flaming lamp, ‘billy’ and all
outside. I hope the strong language and expressions
of disgust have long since been forgiven us; but
I really think they were justified.</p>

<p>Twelve hours’ hard going did the Dome require.
Von Lendenfeld took twenty-seven from the point of
Malte Brun just opposite this camp.</p>

<p>Three hours’ walking the next morning saw us back
at our head-quarters, the Ball Glacier camp, where we
found Dixon in active preparation for an assault
on Aorangi, though not so strong as we could have
wished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Now a great council of war was held, the main
point of discussion being as to whether we should
attempt our long deferred ascent of Aorangi, which
was, as usual, the chief object of our visit to the
glaciers.</p>

<p>Here we were, with provisions for four or five days
longer, the mountain apparently in good order, the
weather perfection, and we were not pushed for time.
The mountain had been inspected by various members
of the party from different coigns of vantage. We had
seen from a distance the <em>névé</em> fields leading on to the
Linda Glacier.</p>

<p>Against this we had first to consider the state of
Dixon’s health. He was quite prepared, and anxious
to try the ascent. We thought that it would be too
much for him. Then there was the accident to the
lamp, which was now useless, there was no firewood
at the bivouac, 7,400 feet up, and no sure means
of procuring water. Annan, too, had to leave to
attend to his work down country, and I think,
if the truth were told, that Johnson and I felt
as if we had had enough of mountaineering for a
time.</p>

<p>Yet we were very loth to turn our faces away again
from the grim giant who had defied us so long, and it
was only with much reluctance that we decided to
abandon the project. So for the third time I retired
from the ramparts of Aorangi unsuccessful, on this
occasion without even so much as an attempt.</p>

<p>We came down to the Hermitage once more, and
after a day or two’s quiet rest yoked Dixon’s celebrated
tandem up, crossed the Tasman River, thus cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>off thirty miles of our homeward journey, and reached
Fairlie Creek in two days. Here I took the train,
whilst Dixon and Johnson drove home. The drive
down and back&mdash;500 miles&mdash;was accomplished in
twelve days’ travelling with the same team of horses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr><br />
<small>FOURTH ATTEMPT TO CLIMB AORANGI</small></h2>

<p class="center1"><i>We reach the Great Plateau at last&mdash;Defeat again&mdash;The Crossing
of the Ball Pass</i></p>

<p class="center">‘Perge et perage.’</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> again, on January 4, 1890, in company with
Mr. Arthur Harper, a gentleman who had then done
two seasons’ climbing in Switzerland, I left Christchurch
to try conclusions afresh with the monarch of
the Southern Alps.</p>

<p>On this occasion we reached the Hermitage in two
days from Christchurch, riding from Fairlie Creek, and
crossing the Tasman River opposite Burnett’s Mount
Cook sheep station. Here we were joined by Annan,
who had already conveyed the bulk of our impedimenta
to the Ball Glacier camp.</p>

<p>On arrival at this point I at once remarked that the
ice of the Ball Glacier had risen above its customary
level, and seemed to be encroaching in a lateral direction&mdash;a
circumstance which undoubtedly points to a
cycle of advance in the great body of the ice, to be
registered at the terminal face in years to come.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to give a description
of our usual Alpine outfit, which may enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>others to glean some idea of what is requisite and convenient
for Alpine work in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The most necessary gear for ice and rock work is
suitable boots, broad-soled and flat-heeled, shod well
but not too thickly with heavy hobs, wrought nails
being preferable to cast. An ice-axe for each man&mdash;not
the light tourist’s axe, but a guide’s axe. Alpine
rope is quite indispensable, and Buckingham’s is the
favourite make; we usually take two or three 50-feet
lengths. Two tents, 6 feet by 8 feet and 6 feet
by 7 feet, the former for use at the head camp, the
latter a tent built after the ‘Whymper’ pattern with
the floor sewn in, but capable of being pitched on
inverted ice-axes lengthened by two 18-inch supplementary
poles (an ingenious contrivance of Dixon’s).
Sleeping bags, 7 feet by 3 feet, made of blanketing, and
covered with an outside bag of oiled calico, impervious
to water. Aneroid, thermometer, prismatic compass,
pocket compass. Goggles (neutral tint) are invaluable,
and save the eyes from the awful glare which is always
experienced on new snow and from the blinding sleet
which drives in a storm. Folding lanterns (Austrian
pattern) often enable one to find the way to camp when
benighted or to make very early starts. A sheath-knife
comes in very handy in camp, and a supply of
fresh nails for our boots is never omitted, whilst a small
‘Aurora’ lamp stove is invaluable above the line of
vegetation, and a shanghai, or common schoolboy’s
window-breaker, is often useful in procuring birds for
the <em>cuisine</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>From a Photograph by A. P. Harper</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>For clothing, woollen shirts and knickerbockers of
warm tweed material are the best, and great comfort is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>to be found in a loose-fitting boating ‘sweater’ worn
over the waistcoat.</p>

<p>For provisions we generally rely on fresh mutton,
to be fried in the pan or boiled in the ‘billy,’ bread,
biscuits, rice, oatmeal, Liebig’s Extract, chocolate, tea,
and so on. A pound or two of fresh butter is always a
boon, and a few tins of marmalade, whilst to some men
onions supply the oft-felt want of a vegetable diet.</p>

<p>There is another indispensable, which here, as in
the Caucasus, is very necessary. I refer to the late
Mr. Donkin’s naïve requisite at the end of his Caucasus
list&mdash;‘infinite patience’; and to this may be
added fixedness of purpose, determination, and perseverance.</p>

<hr class="larger" />

<p>Mount Cook, or Aorangi, from a climber’s point of
view, is a very difficult peak to climb, even to a height
of 9,000 feet, which our party attained on this occasion,
chiefly on account of the length and tiresomeness of
its approach. It is simply part of a great ridge which
branches off in a southerly direction from the main
divide of the Southern Alps. From its three peaks,
all situated on this ridge, diverge four main spurs (or
<em>arêtes</em>, as Alpine men call them). From the lowest
and southernmost peak (11,787 feet) descends to
the Ball Pass the southern <em>arête</em>; from the middle
peak (12,173 feet) the eastern <em>arête</em>, descending on
to an enormous buttress which separates the Ball and
Hochstetter Glaciers; from the northernmost and
highest peak (12,349 feet) two <em>arêtes</em> diverge, the
north-eastern, separating the Hochstetter and Linda
Glaciers and terminating in the ice of the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Plateau; and, lastly, the northern ridge, connecting
with the main divide between Mount Tasman and
St. David’s Dome. A comparatively low rock saddle
in this ridge occurs between the highest peak of
Aorangi and the junction with the main divide, leading
on one hand into the Linda Glacier, and on the other
to the head of the Hooker Glacier. Aorangi is thus
quite cut off from the west coast, and has, in fact, no
‘western flanks,’ as is generally supposed.</p>

<p>It was an intensely hot day, and scarcely a breath
stirred as Harper, Annan, and I struck out on the now
well-known route across the Ball and Hochstetter
Glaciers for the Haast Ridge, but the clear mountain
air seemed to rush into our lungs, putting health and
strength into every fibre.</p>

<p>The mountains were glorious in the noonday glare,
and the foliage on their lower slopes was in its gayest
height of blossom. Now and then an avalanche would
thunder down in the ice-fall or from the higher slopes
above, or the whistle of a kaka down the valley could
be detected. These and the merry tinkling of the
surface streams were the only sounds to break the spell
of silence and benignant peace which seemed to reign
over all. These are the scenes which go straight to
the heart of the true nature-loving mountaineer.</p>

<p>To reach the foot of the <em>couloir</em> by which three
years previously Dixon, Inglis, and I had descended
involved the usual amount of hot scrambling up <em>tali</em>
or fans of detritus from the rocks above. Once in
the <em>couloir</em> (which was snow-filled in places) we were
not long in reaching our old bivouac, where we deposited
our first batch of provisions, &amp;c., our plan being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>to descend again that day and bring up more supplies
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Coming down, Harper had an almost miraculous
escape from swift and certain destruction. We were
glissading on a snow slope when a mass of rocks broke
suddenly away from above and whizzed down the slope
at a terrific rate, passing within a few inches of Harper,
who did not observe them coming, though both Annan
and myself had seen the rocks start a hundred feet or
so above him, and had shouted to warn him of their
descent.</p>

<p>This was a warning to us to be careful how we
trusted snow <em>couloirs</em> during the afternoon, after the
sun’s rays had done their daily work on the crust of the
snow. It is by such lessons that we in New Zealand
have learnt without the aid of Swiss guides to understand,
to appreciate, and circumvent those dangers to
which the Alpine climber is always more or less
exposed.</p>

<p>Another fine morning saw us off again with sleeping-bags,
tent, &amp;c., and by noon we were up at the
bivouac with three days’ supplies. Only resting for an
hour or two we pushed on upwards, intending to cross
the Great Plateau&mdash;that ice-field of which we knew, but
which we seemed fated never to reach&mdash;and find some
sheltering rocks under Aorangi’s uppermost slopes
where we might spend the night.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we reached Mr. Green’s sleeping-place,
across which now lay a rock weighing some tons
(another warning), illustrating forcibly the rotten state
of the rocks.</p>

<p>We now roped and took to the snow, which led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>first on to a small dip or saddle in the ridge (sloping off
on the right to the Freshfield Glacier and on the left
to the Hochstetter ice-fall), and then on to steep snow
slopes leading up to the crest of the ridge overlooking
the plateau, now about 1,000 feet above us.</p>

<p>We proceeded cautiously over many half-covered
crevasses, and crossing the small dip or saddle took to
the slopes beyond, now and then taking to the rocks on
our left. The climbing was somewhat dangerous,
mainly owing to the bad state of the snow, which
would start away in avalanches, or give way on the
edge of a crevasse just at the moment one put one’s
weight on to spring.</p>

<p>At length we gained the highest rocks, which
proved very bad going and seemed likely to bring us
to a stand; but the leading man going up the last fifty
feet alone, sent down a spare rope, making one end fast
above, by whose assistance the second man followed in
safety, the last man making the swags fast to the rope
below to be hauled up. In the act of hoisting them,
however, one broke away, and commenced a furious
flight down the slopes up which we had so laboriously
toiled. To the swag was attached a pannikin and the
tin cistern of our lamp stove, and at every bound we
could hear the rattling of the tin as we watched the
truant bundle leaping down, and we thought of what
might be our fate, were it not for our trusty rope and
axes, should we start unexpectedly down the steep
slopes.</p>

<p>Still down went the swag, turning over on its ends
and bounding over crevasses in a manner which made
us quite envious. At last it hovered on a saddle. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>breathless anxiety we wondered if it would stop, or
whether it would take the slope to the Hochstetter ice-fall
on the one hand, or the Freshfield on the other.
One little effort more it appeared to make, and then
away it went, careering down again towards the Freshfield
ice-fall below.</p>

<p>Our hopes were shattered, and we were fast giving
vent to expressions of despair when the career of the
swag was suddenly cut short in a partially filled <em>bergschrund</em>,
where it was brought up in some soft snow.</p>

<p>We dared not risk staying out for the night where
we were without the lost swag, for no rocks affording
any shelter were available, so determined, after making
a little further progress to get a view of the plateau,
to return to our bivouac at 7,400 feet&mdash;about 1,200 or
1,400 feet below our present altitude&mdash;and make a
fresh attempt on the next day, weather permitting.
The last man came up the rope, and we made our
way up the final slopes of snow on to that great dome
of glacier which we had so often gazed on from below.</p>

<p>Ah, what a sight burst upon our astonished eyes
as we gained its summit!</p>

<p>It seemed the very acme of mountain glory in all
the glories around us. A few hundred feet below lay
that <em>terra incognita</em>, the Great Plateau, rounding off
southwards to the Hochstetter ice-fall, bounded on the
west by the giant form of Aorangi, on the north by
Mount Tasman, and on the east by Mount Haast and
the ridge of that mountain on which we now stood.
The Linda Glacier could just be observed coming round
the north-eastern <em>arête</em> of Aorangi, and on either side
of it towered up to the heavens the two grandest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>mountains in New Zealand&mdash;Aorangi and Mount Tasman;
the former a lowering fortress of black rock and
hanging glaciers, avalanche-streaked throughout, the
latter an ice-clad mass with three summits, covered
thickly with hanging glaciers overlapping one another
as do shingles on a housetop, looking utterly unclimbable.
Only two masses of rock are visible, over
which avalanches constantly swept.</p>

<p>The sight is certainly the grandest of its kind I have
seen in the Southern Alps, and Harper tried in vain to
recall its equal in Switzerland.</p>

<p>After working our way upwards along the ridge to
the nearest rocks we deposited a note of our visit in a
pannikin, and building a small cairn over it, beat a
retreat.</p>

<p>We experienced some difficulty in getting down the
top rocks, but eventually gained our footsteps in the
snow, and following down the route of the truant swag,
recovered it from its snowy bed some 600 feet below
the point where it commenced its downward journey.</p>

<p>We arrived at the bivouac just before dark, and
had scarcely finished brewing a warm drink when
down came a nor’-wester upon us.</p>

<p>Pitching the tent was out of the question, so piling
stones upon it we spent a miserably cold night, and by
the time morning came all thoughts of tackling Aorangi
had flown, and soon we were speeding down to our
refuge at the Ball Glacier camp again.</p>

<p>Thus ignominiously ended my fourth attempt to
climb Mount Cook.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Annan went down the valley with
directions to join us two days afterwards at the Hermit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>age,
Harper and myself being determined to cross the
southern spur of Aorangi at the head of the Ball
Glacier, and work our way down the Hooker Glacier to
the Hermitage.</p>


<p class="center">THE FIRST CROSSING OF THE BALL PASS</p>

<p>Starting on a misty morning, we climbed what we
call the Ball Glacier spur&mdash;a ridge which diverges
from the main ridge of the Mount Cook Range at a
point immediately south of the Ball Pass. It was by
this ridge that Mr. Green’s first and unsuccessful
attempt was made, and up this same route I had climbed
the previous season with the photographer.</p>

<p>The major part of the climb is easy, good foothold
being obtained on the red sandstone rocks. In the
upper part snow-fields alternate with the rocks. The
Ball Glacier lies couched in the valley on the right, vast
precipices going sheer down to it from the crest of the
ridge, whilst the slopes on the left descend to the
Tasman Valley.</p>

<p>After four hours of climbing we reached the main
southern <em>arête</em>, and paused on the snow saddle for lunch
and rest, and to admire the splendid prospect of the
eastern faces of the mountain, and the ever-fresh, marvellous
panorama of the Tasman Glacier.</p>

<p>Erecting a cairn on the rocks close by, and christening
the saddle after that father of mountaineering&mdash;John
Ball&mdash;we commenced the descent on a good snow
slope towards the Hooker Glacier. All the mountains
on the western side were enveloped in mist, which,
however, fortunately hung high enough to enable us to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>discern the whole extent of the Mueller Glacier and
most of that of the Hooker.</p>

<p>Bearing away southwards to avoid the crevassed
parts of the slope below, we were soon enjoying a merry
glissade&mdash;sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, whizzing
down in a cloud of snow which curled up from our
feet and showered down upon us.</p>

<p>Ah, the exhilaration of a good glissade! How you
seem to fly through the air and cleave the fast-speeding
surface! How the snow hisses and the axe grinds!
How the excitement thrills you as you look out for
danger ahead, or rushing avalanches behind! There
is nothing to touch it&mdash;switchback railway, going downhill
on a bicycle, skating&mdash;all are far behind.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour we entered a rocky gorge,
and still down we sped on the snow, winding about in
and out between magnificent rock precipices, until
before another fifteen minutes had elapsed we emerged
into the Hooker Valley, having come down 4,000 feet
under half an hour.</p>

<p>Turning down the valley we kept to the old lateral
moraine of the Hooker Glacier (which stands 235 feet
above the present level of the glacier), and found it
good walking.</p>

<p>Once more, however, fortune forsook us, and an
enemy in the shape of a south-west gale, accompanied
with heavy rain, met us, against which at times we
could scarcely make any headway. But struggling
on we crossed the Hooker River on the ice of the
Mueller Glacier, which at that time spanned it, and
reached the Hermitage drenched to the skin at 4.30&mdash;eight
hours from the Ball Glacier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>This was the first, and up to the time of writing is
the only crossing of the Ball Pass, an excursion which
ere long must become a favourite one, for a track is
just completed to the Ball Glacier, where a two-roomed
hut has been erected by the Government for the use of
tourists and mountaineers.</p>

<p>A finer point of observation than the Ball Pass
would be hard to find, as it commands the most comprehensive
views of the Tasman, Hooker, and Mueller
Glacier systems.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr><br />
<small>THE FIRST EXPLORATION OF THE MURCHISON GLACIER</small></h2>

<p class="center1"><i>Hard Swagging&mdash;Erroneous Maps&mdash;The Struggle for Starvation
Saddle&mdash;Exhaustion and Hunger&mdash;Return</i></p>

<p class="center">‘Fresh fields and pastures new.’</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> often cast a longing eye in the direction of the
Murchison Valley, and desired to explore those unvisited
scenes which were as yet unknown and unseen
by man. We had frequently during this visit to the
district spoken of making an excursion in that direction
should Mount Cook prove too heavy metal for us.
Now was our chance, and we determined to take it.</p>

<p>Leaving the Hermitage with an addition to our
party in the shape of Messrs. Wells, Timson, and
Hamilton&mdash;the former two only intending to visit the
Tasman Glacier, and the latter anxious to accompany
us on the Murchison trip&mdash;we made the Ball Glacier
camp, after the usual hard, hot grind over the moraine,
by evening.</p>

<p>The next morning breaking fine, Wells and Timson
went for an hour’s excursion on to the glacier opposite,
returning enchanted with the grand view of the Hochstetter
ice-fall and the surrounding peaks, whilst the
rest of us&mdash;viz. Harper, Hamilton, Annan, and myself&mdash;prepared
swags for a two days’ excursion up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Murchison Valley, whose mouth could be discerned
some two miles distant across the Tasman Glacier.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of notice that with the exception
of mountaineering parties equipped for climbing&mdash;and
the numbers of these could be counted on the fingers
of both hands&mdash;Messrs. Wells and Timson were the
first two tourists to venture so far up the Tasman as
our camp, and since that time only one other has succeeded
in reaching the same point, that gentleman being
his Excellency the Earl of Onslow, Governor of the
colony, whose practical penetration regarding all
matters connected with New Zealand entitles him to
the respect and gratitude of those subjects over whom
he exercises vice-regal control.</p>

<p>Since the visit of Lord Onslow a track which had
then been formed within two or three miles of the Ball
Glacier has been completed, making the task of reaching
the spot one of comparative ease and pleasure.
Further conveniences for tourists and mountaineers
in the shape of tracks and huts are now in course of
construction by a far-seeing Government, who recognise
the fact that New Zealand is fast becoming the playground
of Australasia and the Switzerland of the South.</p>

<p>From careful inquiries made at the Survey Office,
from Mr. Sealy&mdash;a gentleman whose early work of exploration
amongst the New Zealand glaciers is too
readily forgotten&mdash;and from the run-holders and station
hands in the district, we had every reason to believe
that the valley had only once been entered (by Mr.
Burnett of Mount Cook sheep station), and that the
face of the glacier had never been reached; only in one
case could we hear of the clear ice having been seen&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>viz.,
by a shepherd of Mr. Burnett’s from a peak of the
Liebig range.</p>

<p>There was therefore little or no doubt that we had
a virgin field before us, and it was with feelings of intense
eagerness that we pressed forward across the
moraine-covered part of the Tasman Glacier, and up
the shingle flats of the river-bed beyond, towards that
massive, moraine-covered terminal face which fills the
valley from side to side, five miles from the eastern
lateral face of the Tasman Glacier.</p>

<p>The valley appeared to be a little over one mile in
width. On either hand rose up most beautifully grassed
slopes thickly covered with every variety of sub-Alpine
foliage decked in the gayest height of blossom.</p>

<p>What a place for an artist’s holiday! Flowers innumerable
dotted amongst the richest shades of green&mdash;lilies,
celmisias in great variety, Spaniards of many
kinds with their golden and spiky heads of various
shapes and sizes, from the orange-coloured dwarf to
the great blue Spaniard with stalks occasionally ten
feet in height; snow-grass with its graceful seed-stalks
gently waving in the morning zephyr, which seemed to
fan all Nature into a soft and dreamy repose&mdash;such
wealth of colour, such variety of form, such grandeur
of outline in the looming peaks above!</p>

<p>Yes; here the artist might fairly lose himself in
delight amongst the subjects for his brush whilst
drinking in the pure sympathy with Nature which
seems to float in the very air.</p>

<p>It is no dream, this lovely valley, though it seems
as one. But its flowers go with the warm geniality of
summer, and when the cold winter comes round it dons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>its white garment of snow, hiding its beauties until the
hand of gentle spring once more wakens them to burst
forth anew in all their resplendent glory.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the valley between these magnificent
mountains we kept moving onward in a north-easterly
direction under the flanks of the Malte Brun
Range, on to whose slopes we were now and then forced
by encroaching streams from the meandering river, and
we arrived early in the afternoon at a large boulder-fan
issuing from a rocky gorge above, whence a magnificent
waterfall descended. Here we boiled the ‘billy’ and
lunched, making an inspection of the scene, which is
one of the grandest beauty.</p>

<p>Far up in the heavens stands out a noble peak of
the Malte Brun Range, rising out of a glacier which
nestles in a basin of rock and bristles with <em>séracs</em> and
pinnacles of blue ice pouring into the gorge below,
from whence issues an imposing waterfall of seventy or
eighty feet, sending up clouds of spray and drenching
all within its immediate vicinity. From long action of
the water an almost semicircular cylinder about ten
feet in circumference has been worn into the solid rock,
and the force of water descending this strange funnel
seems to drive out in one direction a current of air
which carries the spray with it.</p>

<p>All around this fall the vegetation is most luxuriant,
and the rocks are covered with flowering plants in great
profusion, and, in parts where the spray falls, plants,
rare elsewhere, notably the myosotis, flourish in the
abundant moisture.</p>

<p>Taking a more northerly direction we came to the
terminal face of the glacier, which by aneroid measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>ment
we made 3,640 feet&mdash;much the same altitude as
our Ball Glacier camp. The survey of the glacier has,
however, since been effected, and this point determined
as 3,305 feet.</p>

<p>The moraine is composed of unusually large polyhedral
masses of rock, and is 200 feet in height at the
main exit of the river, which is situated about the
middle of the terminal face.</p>

<p>A backward view down the valley revealed but one
distant peak&mdash;Mount Sealy&mdash;the northernmost of the
Ben Ohau Range. This peak was evidently the only
one from which the clear ice of the Murchison can be
seen, if we except those of the Liebig and Malte Brun
Ranges, and as none of these peaks have been ascended,
this fact probably accounts for the Murchison Glacier,
which is the second largest in New Zealand, having lain
so long unexplored.</p>

<p>Proceeding up on the western side of the moraine,
a new branch glacier descending from the Malte Brun
Range opened out on our left, its lower ice forming a
fine frozen cascade, whilst a waterfall of some 200 feet
descends over a rocky face from its southern and
hanging portion. To this glacier and fall we have
given the name of ‘Onslow,’ in honour of his
Excellency the Earl of Onslow.</p>

<p>As it was now getting dark we decided to bivouac
for the night, and selecting a bed of small gravel
amongst the larger stones of the moraine, we dined
scantily on cold mutton and tea, and wriggling into
our waterproof blanket-bags were soon ready for sleep.
At first all our attempts at slumber were rendered
futile by a congregation of keas, who hopped around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>within a few feet of us, jabbering and swearing in
their own peculiar language at such a party of intruders
on their domain.</p>

<p>The night was spent in comparative comfort, for
we were beginning to feel the effects of our desperate
swagging, and could go to sleep almost anywhere.
It is simply astonishing what a man can put up with,
when he has to; I have slept soundly in all sorts of
queer positions, even upon a mixture of ice and sharp
stones, without a tent and with only one thickness of
blanket, when the thermometer has been several degrees
below freezing point.</p>

<p>We were early aroused in the morning by the
persistent attentions of the keas; they even went the
length of pecking at our sleeping-bags, so tame and
unaccustomed to man are they in these parts. We all
wanted more rest, but it was not to be thought of
if we adhered to our original plan of crossing a supposed
saddle at the head of the Murchison to the
Tasman Glacier by Mount Darwin, and returning to our
head-quarters after accomplishing the circuit of the
Malte Brun Range.</p>

<p>We were soon off, and toiled up the small valley
formed by the lateral moraine of the glacier and the
slopes of the Malte Brun Range. About a mile or so
up we observed another glacier lying in a comparatively
low saddle above us on our left, beyond this a
rocky spur, and then another and larger branch glacier
which for a time we took to be the main body of the
Murchison, as indicated by the maps. We made for it
and climbed its enormous face of ice, and then we
discovered our error, for there, a mile away across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>the moraine, lay the clear ice of the Murchison, and
far, far away northwards, the valley extended completely
filled with a magnificent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mer de glace</i> of pure
white ice. We stood transfixed, for none of us had
imagined that such a grand glacier lay beyond.</p>

<p>Now we saw what was before us, and for a long
time debated as to our ability to face the work
ahead.</p>

<p>Hamilton was shockingly out of condition, and a
sinew in my leg was becoming painful, Nature at last
rebelling against the strain to which she was being
subjected. We had a very scanty supply of provisions,
and evidently it meant spending another night out if
we proceeded.</p>

<p>The temptation was too much for us. We could
not let this prize slip through our fingers, so we decided
to go on and put ourselves on starvation rations rather
than turn. Away we struck over the moraine, and in
an hour’s time reached the clear ice, here much
crevassed. Crossing with some difficulty we lunched
on the eastern side. Casting our eyes backward we
could see splendidly all the fine peaks we had been
passing under, and could observe the continuation of
the range north-eastwards with five or six more branch
glaciers, the final one northward leading to a snow-field
with a saddle at its head. This, then, must be
our saddle, we thought. But it seemed hopeless to
cross it in our tired condition and with our heavy
swags.</p>

<p>We set our teeth, however, and went doggedly
forward, striking out on to the clear ice again and
making a north-easterly course, at each step realising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>more and more the grandeur of the immense ice-field
now gradually opening out and unfolding the wealth of
mountain glory which encloses it.</p>

<p>We tried in vain to identify Mount Darwin or the
most northerly peaks of the Malte Brun Range, which
we knew were amongst those on our left, and, according
to our reckoning by the maps&mdash;framed from Von
Haast’s&mdash;which seems to have been compiled from
guesswork as far as this locality is concerned&mdash;we
should at this time have been on the Classen Glacier,
which lies at the southern head of the Godley River,
and, in reality, was some miles north over the Liebig
Range.</p>

<p>Passing several branch glaciers on our left, and
observing that those on our right were assuming larger
proportions, we sidled obliquely across and made for
the snow-field leading to the saddle which we had every
reason to believe led into the Tasman. Altering our
course to due north, and crossing the lower and sloppy
part of the snow-field, which was flat and quite undrained
by crevasses, we were soon on snow in miserable
order, and putting on the rope we wound our way
gently upwards amongst the crevasses now beginning
to appear.</p>

<p>We had just six hours of daylight, and considered
we could reach the saddle in four if all went well,
which would leave us two hours to find a bivouac on
the other side, provided the descent were feasible.</p>

<p>We found it necessary to change leaders again and
again to distribute the arduous task of breaking steps
in treacherous snow, just in the condition to let us
through knee-deep as we put our weight on it, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>had to observe the greatest caution in crossing the
crevasses, which were very deep and almost invariably
half covered, or had edges fringed with cornices of soft
snow, which at times had to be removed or trodden
down to enable us to obtain a sound footing on the
hard edges concealed beneath it.</p>

<p>The grade steepened, and we all felt the hard work,
more especially Hamilton, who was sadly out of form,
but stuck to his work like a Trojan, despite the cruel
punishing his swags were giving him.</p>

<p>Now we had to make our way across a slope where
an avalanche had recently come, and, worse than all, a
thick mist accompanied by a keen wind began to come
over our saddle.</p>

<p>Still we pushed slowly upwards, resting every few
minutes. Thoughts of turning began to arise in
our doubting minds. But this would not do with the
col so nearly within our grasp, and the cry was almost
one of ‘Death or victory!’ as we plodded laboriously upwards.
Sometimes we could not see fifty feet ahead,
and were compelled to steer by the compass, taking
bearings of crevasses and ice blocks as we proceeded.
Now and then the mist would lift for a moment and we
could catch a glimpse of the longed-for saddle, and at
last, when within a couple of hundred feet, Annan and
I cast off on a separate rope, made a rush&mdash;as much of a
rush as we could muster up&mdash;for the goal, hoping at
least to get a glimpse of the other side ere the mist
became too dense.</p>

<p>Hurrah! the saddle was conquered! But what lay
beneath? Mist! Mist! Nothing but a thick impenetrable
mist.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>The other men arrived, and simultaneously, as if by
some providential magic, the fog began to dissipate.</p>

<p>As it cleared we looked in vain for the familiar
points at the head of the Tasman, which Annan and I
knew full well. ‘Where’s Darwin? Where’s Elie de
Beaumont? Where’s the Dome?’ No point in sight
could be associated with the prominent features of the
Tasman. As the low-lying portions of the mist disappeared,
we observed that the glacier below flowed
to the right! The Tasman should have flowed in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon us, and a great cry of
surprise went up, ‘The Murchison! The Murchison!’
The very glacier whose middle parts we had left three
hours previously.</p>

<p>Then, leaving Hamilton exhausted on the saddle, the
rest of us struck up to some rocks 300 feet higher on
the right, and once more a great shout arose as Annan
and I saw coming into view the unmistakable double
top of the great Hochstetter Dome, whose proud summit
we had trodden the previous season.</p>

<p>From these rocks we observed that the course of the
glacier commenced under a peak on our left (which
must be Mount Darwin itself), and running in a northerly
direction for some four or five miles, turning round the
end of the spur upon which our saddle was situated,
assumed a south-westerly course.</p>

<p>The true saddle between the Murchison and Tasman
lay across the glacier below, north-west. Straight
ahead of us, north by west, visible over a rocky and
unnamed peak on the opposite side of the valley, lay
the Dome, then to the north another snow saddle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>evidently leading into the Whymper Glacier, and so on
to the Wataroa River of the west coast. Following
round the range to the right a very fine mountain
stands boldly up; to the right of this, again, is situated
yet another snow saddle, which we concluded must
lead into the Classen Glacier.</p>

<p>The result of the Government survey of the
Murchison Glacier, just completed (1891), confirms our
surmises regarding the topography of this interesting
district.</p>

<p>We were astonished at the great length which the
Liebig Range assumes, for it bounds the glacier
throughout the whole of its eastern side, diverging from
the main chain of the Southern Alps some distance
north of the Hochstetter Dome.</p>

<p>Any attempt at a description of the panorama from
our saddle would be useless to convey an adequate idea
of the view. Harper classed it as similar in character
to the views obtained at high altitudes in the Bernese
Oberland. An aneroid reading gave our height as
about 7,900 feet, but this was much out, as by the
recent survey the height of the saddle has been trigonometrically
determined as 7,194 feet. Our estimate of
the length of the glacier at the time was twelve miles,
and the survey has now fixed it at eleven and a half,
whilst the average width is as nearly as possible one
mile.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Reaching the saddle into the Tasman was now quite
out of the question, for it would involve a descent to
the valley below, the crossing of the upper parts of the
glacier, and the scaling of more snow slopes, which
appeared to us to be impracticable owing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>numerous crevasses. In addition to this, one man was
lying <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i> on the snow suffering from exhaustion
and vomiting. Evidently the only course we could
pursue was to retrace our upward route, and that as
quickly as possible, for there were but three hours of
daylight left to reach a bivouac in the rocks lower
down.</p>

<p>After erecting a small cairn, depositing a record of
our ascent, and giving three cheers for nobody quite
knew what, we roped up and began the descent.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how one’s spirits revive when a fresh
set of muscles is brought into action, aided by the force
of gravitation, and though we had been defeated in our
attempt to reach the Tasman, what did that matter?
Though we were half-dead with starvation&mdash;‘Starvation
Saddle’ is now the name of our <em>col</em>&mdash;and though a real
weariness of the flesh had taken hold of us, what
matter? We had explored (I might almost say discovered)
the great glacier we had come out to see, and
would be able to settle all sorts of topographical errors
in the maps, and could speak with authority about
many square miles of Alpine country hitherto entirely
unknown.</p>

<p>Our spirits rose as we descended, despite our hungry
and tired state, and we once more wound our way
down among the crevasses, and reaching the glacier
again made for the lowest point we could before night
closed in. But we had an hour’s cruel moraine work
in the dark ere we found a sleeping-place on a bed of
lilies, where we boiled our last drop of Liebig and
divided our remaining crust of bread.</p>

<p>It rained a little during the night, but we did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>care for that with our oilskin bags, and sleep visited
our weary eyelids as it had never done before.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s condition had improved, but his feet
were sore and he was very weak when at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we
once more set off for our home on the glaciers&mdash;the
Ball Glacier camp. The prospect of boiled rice and
fresh chops lured us on as we made our way down the
valley, and putting forth our last remaining energy we
made the ever-welcome refuge in eight hours, Harper,
who had most left in him, going on ahead and preparing
a substantial feed for the stragglers behind.</p>

<p>Oh, that tin plate of rice, <i>and</i> those chops, <i>and</i> that
tea!</p>

<p>How came an exhibition of pluck rarely seen. After
two hours’ rest Hamilton said he must reach the
Hermitage that night; despite our dissuasions he determined
to go on, and Annan generously volunteered
to accompany him. These two men actually reached
the Hermitage that evening at 8.30. It was the
pluckiest day’s work I have ever seen done in the
mountains.</p>

<p>Harper and I came down next day in a snow storm,
with fifty-pound swags.</p>

<p>Many people seem to think that a visit to the
Alpine regions necessarily entails contact with very
cold weather, even in the summer time. This is quite
an erroneous idea, for on this occasion the thermometer
readings at the lower camp varied from 42° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> in
the morning to 72° in the evening, and I should think
that even during the coldest night the instrument did
not register much lower than the first-named figure.
We frequently went about in shirt and knickers only,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and the usual complaint is of the heat, not of the cold.
Some men suffer a good deal of discomfort from sunburn.
I myself am a victim in this respect. It is the
upper and freshly fallen snow which is so ruinous to
the epidermis, the reflection from the new and unmelted
crystals being so great as to cause the skin to
assume a dark chocolate colour even during one-day’s
work amongst it.</p>

<p>Sometimes blisters form, after which the skin puckers
up and eventually peels off in patches. The noses of
persons possessed of aquiline features are usually a
study in themselves after a day or two’s exposure on
new snow.</p>

<p>Had we been consistently following in the footsteps
of trained guides we should not have concerned ourselves
about this, that, and the other, but would have
left everything to the men of experience, simply being
towed about in their wake; whereas we have been
obliged to train and exercise all those qualities which
a guide possesses, perforce.</p>

<p>Naturally, too, a colonial life is more calculated to
teach self-reliance and independence, and from our
earliest schoolboy days we have been accustomed to
rough work on the hills, pig-hunting, &amp;c., and in camp
life on all sorts of hare-brained expeditions. I have,
indeed, been in many an awkward place amongst rocks
when out on the foot-hills, and must have&mdash;perhaps
unconsciously&mdash;acquired many of those qualities which
denote the cragsman.</p>

<p>Want of fixedness of purpose had often lured us
away from the peak, and temptations in glacier expeditions
had thwarted our determination. I felt confident,
however, if Dixon and I got together again we
should make a good fight of it with the mountain,
for we had learnt to place confidence in each other in
many rough trips, and Dixon was a man after my own
heart for determination.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1890, then, for the last time Dixon
and I found ourselves on the way to the Mount Cook
district; we reached Burke’s Pass that evening in an
express waggon which contained besides ourselves two
small Rob Roy canoes, it being our intention to navigate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the Waitaki River from Aorangi to the sea&mdash;should we
not previously leave our lifeless bodies at the foot of
some precipice or frozen in a crevasse, as many of our
friends prophesied.</p>

<p>December 2 saw us crossing the Tasman River in
our canoes ten miles below its exit from the glacier, and
as it was in flood and running full ten knots, with waves
four or five feet high in the rapids, we had an exciting
time of it, yet managed to reach the Hermitage side in
safety, but not without shipping a good deal of water.
This was the first case of a boat of any kind being on
these rushing waters, and our good friends in all directions
prophesied dire disaster to what they were pleased
to term our ‘rash venture.’ We are getting quite
used to these consolations of our friends, who seem
quite disappointed that we do not afford them some
sensational obituary matter in the daily papers.</p>

<p>Again the faithful Annan was at hand, and greeted
us at the Hooker wire rope with the pleasing intelligence
that our camp at the Ball Glacier was fixed and our
swags conveyed there. The Government surveyor
(Mr. Brodrick) and his party were at hand too, and
working their way to the Murchison Glacier to make
a survey in continuation of their work on the Tasman;
we spent the following night in comfort at their lower
camp, one mile above the terminal face of the Tasman
Glacier, to which point a horse track had already been
formed through the scrub.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Again we carried our swags up that cruel piece of
walking to the Ball Glacier camp, stopping half-way
for lunch at our customary resting-place&mdash;‘The Cove’&mdash;a
snug little nook in a rock-face where a rill from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>the mountain side offers cool refreshment to the weary
swagger.</p>

<p>Friday morning, December 5, found us early astir,
and making up swags of blanket-bags, tent, tinned
meats, biscuits, chocolate, raisins, prunes, rice, oatmeal,
Liebig’s Extract, and all such necessaries as might
ensure sustenance and a certain degree of comfort at a
high bivouac. Seeing that our boots were well nailed,
our ice-axes and snow-goggles in good order, we
struck out across the Ball and Hochstetter Glaciers and
reached the foot of our climb&mdash;the southern termination
of the ridge of Mount Haast. Here we deposited
a small supply of provisions as a standby, in case we
should be driven back by bad weather or by some
unforeseen cause.</p>

<p>The day was very warm, and as we toiled slowly
up under the weight of our heavy swags (we were
carrying enough provisions to last us for some days)
the perspiration streamed from every pore, and the
sun’s rays seemed to penetrate with singular fierceness.</p>

<p>Soon we came to the lower termination of the new
and unmelted winter snow in the <em>couloirs</em> or ditches
between the rock ridges, and as the day advanced the
hissing avalanches came down these slopes with increasing
frequency, and falling stones and rocks now
and again passed close by us. The snow being in such
a loose and slushy condition it was imperative that we
should avoid it as much as possible, but climb as
we would we could not help occasionally crossing a
snow-filled <em>couloir</em>, and this had to be accomplished
with much celerity and caution.</p>

<p>Annan was particularly anxious concerning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>‘shocking state of repair’ of these lower slopes, and
seemed to lose his nerve entirely, though he is accustomed
to work on the higher beats in mustering, &amp;c.,
and he declared his intention of going no farther than
the bivouac at 7,400 feet, which we reached in the
afternoon. We at once saw that it would be useless
and dangerous to persuade him to join us in the final
assault, for if his self-reliance failed on these lower
slopes, what would the state of his nerve be on the
upper ice work where so much step-cutting would be
necessary? Dixon and I knew that we ought not to
try to ascend the peak alone, that such work as we&mdash;two
guideless amateurs&mdash;were about to attempt, would not
be looked upon with favour by such a body as the
English Alpine Club; but we were so tired of knuckling
under to Aorangi that we were becoming desperate,
and we decided to try conclusions without a third man.</p>

<p>Two hours of excavation work removed two feet of
snow and eighteen inches of ice from our bivouac,
revealing the faithful ‘Aurora’ stove and sundry potted
meats left twelve months before by Harper and myself,
and soon we had the tent pitched and were snug for the
night.</p>

<p>At three o’clock on the Saturday morning Dixon
and I crawled out of our sleeping-bags, and by 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
we were on the snow slopes, determined to make a
vigorous attack upon the peak which had so long
defied us.</p>

<p>Two hours on fairly good snow slopes and a
scramble over a nasty slab-like face of rock, and
once again the plateau, and that glorious scene of
Aorangi and Tasman, were before us.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>But the wind had risen quickly and was blowing a
gale from the south-west&mdash;the cold quarter. To face
such a wind for any length of time, or to attempt to
climb Aorangi against it, would be simple madness, so
we turned and ignominiously fled to the refuge of our
bivouac, 1,200 feet below, which we reached at seven
o’clock, having been but three hours absent.</p>

<p>We then sent Annan down, as we were keeping him
from his work in the lower country, telling him to leave
word with the survey party that if we did not arrive
back at the Ball Glacier by Monday night something
would probably have gone amiss with us.</p>

<p>During the day the gale blew itself out, and next
morning at 3.45 we were in our steps of the day before,
reaching the plateau in an hour and a half. The morning
sun lit up the peaks with a rosy glow, soon his
piercing beams forced us to put on the goggles, while
the crust of the snow began to soften under the great
power of penetration which the rays possess in the
rarefied air. This forced us to plod onward in slushy
snow as we headed right for the Linda Glacier, which
we could see rounding the point of the north-eastern
<em>arête</em> of our mountain.</p>

<p>On our right rose Mount Tasman clothed in ice,
from which during the night an immense avalanche
had descended. We walked close to its furthest point
of motion as it lay stretched out on the level snow-field
like a gigantic breakwater, and found it to be 300
paces in width; Dixon estimated that it covered from
forty to fifty acres.</p>

<p>We now put on the rope, as crevasses began to
appear in the gently rising slopes to the Linda Glacier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>On our left we thought that the north-eastern ridge
looked practicable, but deemed it better to rely on a
route chosen by so able a mountaineer as Ulrich Kaufmann,
and kept on our course for the Linda Glacier,
taking ten-minute spells at leading and breaking steps
in the soft and slushy snow, and winding our way
amongst ever-increasing crevasses in search of snow
bridges over which we would cautiously crawl.</p>

<p>Now we would have a stretch of gently rising snow,
then a crevasse or perhaps a <em>bergschrund</em>, followed by
a steep ascent for 100 or 200 feet, then a divergence to
one side or the other to avoid a chaos of <em>séracs</em> or
blocks of tumbled and broken ice; and so on, hour
after hour. About noon we had gained a considerable
elevation above the plateau and were well round the
corner on the Linda Glacier. Into this elevated valley
the sun poured down through a rarefied atmosphere on
to slopes on either hand which reflected all the light
and heat. The glare was something dreadful, and
before midday our faces and hands had assumed the
customary chocolate colour, and the skin was literally
broiled off me; Dixon did not suffer to such an extent.
The heat was most intense, though not of the enervating
kind which one feels at lower altitudes.</p>

<p>Viewed from this quarter Aorangi presents a totally
different form than from any other, and we began to be
sanguine about accomplishing our task. I was in
possession of notes and sketches of the route kindly
sent me by Mr. Green, and these were of material
assistance to us.</p>

<p>Before us lay the final peak with its capping of ice.
From the summit, now in full view, descended in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>north-westerly direction to the right a steep rocky <em>arête</em>
connecting with the ridge leading on to Mount Tasman.
From the lower parts of these rocks steep ice slopes
streaked with marks from falling rocks descend to the
upper portions of the Linda Glacier, bounded all along
their lower termination by an immense <em>bergschrund</em>
which severs them from immediate contact with the
glacier itself.</p>

<p>On the left of the summit slopes the north-eastern
<em>arête</em>, consisting of a ridge of alternate knife-edges of
ice and <em>gensdarmes</em> or towers of rock. The northern
side or face of this ridge descending to the Linda
Glacier is composed of very steep slopes of ice set with
three immense masses of red sandstone rocks, with two
ice-filled <em>couloirs</em> or ditches between them. Up these
two <em>couloirs</em> lay our route. We thought, however,
that by leaving the glacier and taking to the crest of
the ridge we could improve on the route, but soon
found that the change was a mistake, and so struck
back on to our old course up the middle of the
glacier, the final slopes of which were very steep and
exposed to the chance of avalanches from either hand.</p>

<p>It seemed a hopeless task this plunging through
soft snow hour after hour, and it was nearly one o’clock
ere we gained the edge of the big <em>bergschrund</em> and with
difficulty discovered a sound enough snow bridge.
Shortly before this an incident occurred in crossing
one of these snow bridges which brought forcibly
before our minds the serious nature of the work in
which we were engaged. I&mdash;the lighter man by two
stone&mdash;had crawled over in safety, and planting myself
well in the soft snow above, was taking in the slack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>the rope as Dixon followed, when suddenly he went
through up to his armpits and was dangling in space,
held up by a thin crust of snow and by the rope from
above. I pulled with the strength of despair, and
Dixon struggled till he secured a hold somehow on
the other lip of the crevasse and got out.</p>

<p>That sort of thing is all very well to look back
upon and talk over afterwards, but I am not likely to
forget for many a long day the sensation of holding up
a thirteen-stone man under such circumstances, and I
must say that I should have been much easier in my
mind if we had had such a man as Emil Boss or Ulrich
Kaufmann on one end of the rope.</p>

<p>Immediately after crossing the big <em>bergschrund</em> step-cutting
commenced; and from this point upwards
every step, other than those on rocks, had to be cut
in hard ice.</p>

<p>It is no easy task after climbing steadily for nine
hours in soft snow to set to work and cut steps, especially
when one knows that a slip must on no account
be made, for with two men only on the rope it would
mean a sudden descent to the crevasses or precipices
(as the case may be) below, and our certain destruction.</p>

<p>An hour’s steady work and we gained the foot
of the lowest rocks, which were found to be quite
unscalable. We then sidled round the base of these
rocks to the left and commenced cutting steps up the
first <em>couloir</em>, keeping close into the rocks on our right,
on which we could get an occasional hand-grip.
Ice blocks were continually coming down from the
broken masses overhanging the top of the <em>couloir</em>, but
luckily none struck us. The descent of an ice block in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>such steep ice slopes is something to remember. First
a rattle above, and then ‘swish, swish’ as the first
leaps begin, followed by a ‘whir-r-r-r’ and a
‘hum-m-m-m’ as, like a flash of light, a spinning
and ricochetting object goes by and is lost to sight
over the brink of the precipice below, or perchance is
detected spending its momentum on the soft snow
slopes 1,000 feet down.</p>

<p>These falls of ice on the upper slopes are not like
the hissing avalanches, which sometimes even <i>crawl</i>
down the lower snow slopes, but come down with the
speed of light, and are calculated to strike terror into
the heart of the stoutest-nerved climber.</p>

<p>We crossed the <em>couloir</em> near its head, partly on ice
and partly on rocks, amid the gravest peril from
showers of ice, and took to the rocks on our left, which
were both dangerous and difficult, mainly owing to
their being here and there coated with ice. Soon they
became quite inaccessible, and we were again forced
towards our left on to the ice slopes in the second
<em>couloir</em>, and here we found the ice even harder, and we
could only make an impression on it with the spike
end of our axes. To add to the difficulty, the angle of
ascent became steeper, inclining in places to about 60°
from the horizontal.</p>

<p>We negotiated this <em>couloir</em> in a similar manner to
that below, but water trickling from the overhanging
rocks formed awkward hummocks of ice on the slope
close to the rocks, over which we thought it almost
impossible to climb, and to go out into the middle of
the <em>couloir</em> was impossible, owing to falling ice.</p>

<p>Time was quickly passing, and we had a terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>fight to reach the head of the <em>couloir</em>. The rocks now
shaded us from the sun’s rays, and soon our hats, coats,
and the rope were frozen as stiff as boards, while the
cold was so intense as to cause the skin of our hands
to adhere to the steel of the ice-axes.</p>

<p>It seemed now more than ever a hopeless task to
reach the final ice-cap, which we knew could not be
far above us; but we silently and doggedly cut away,
and at length were rewarded by finding the rocks on
our right practicable; taking to them we were soon on
their crest, and the ice-cap of the mountain lay straight
before us. An easy bit of rock-climbing led up to the
slopes, which we found to be covered with a peculiar
form of lumpy and frozen drifted snow. At the top of
the rocks we looked around in vain for Mr. Green’s
cairn, with his handkerchief and Kaufmann’s matchbox,
left on the occasion of their ascent in March 1882.
Doubtless they have either been long since swept away
by falling ice or were buried in the terminal of the
ice slope, which in December would encroach farther
down upon the rocks than in March.</p>

<p>Dixon now counselled a retreat, arguing that we
had virtually overcome all the difficulties and had only
the final and easy slope to cut up; but I persuaded
him to stay a little longer and make a push for it, or at
least as much of a push as we were capable of making.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>From a Water-colour Sketch</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was half-past five. Four hours and a half we
had been toiling from the head of the Linda Glacier,
thirteen hours and a half from our bivouac, without
any halt to speak of. A wind began to blow from the
north-west, adding fresh cause for anxiety about the
descent. One thing was certain&mdash;if we wanted to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>down alive we should have to reach the Linda Glacier
again before dark.</p>

<p>We worked as hard as we were able at step-cutting
for another fifteen minutes, but only made slow progress;
yet there was the cornice, just away to the
right, the crest of the ridge to the left, and the top
scarcely a stone’s throw above, with no difficulty in
the way. What would we not have given for another
hour of daylight? How could we turn away when so
near to a complete victory over our old foe?</p>

<p>Dixon again suggested turning, and I could not do
otherwise than defer to his advice, for already we were
caught in a trap, and should bad weather come upon
us&mdash;and the wind and cold were fast increasing&mdash;before
we reached the Linda Glacier again the probabilities
were that we never should have returned from the
giddy heights of the great Aorangi, the ‘Sky-piercer.’</p>

<p>The height of the mountain is 12,349 feet; our
aneroid read at our turning-point 12,300, and we
reckoned the summit to be 140 feet above us. The
slight error in the reading of the instrument would be
accounted for by the impending change of weather.</p>

<p>The view is magnificently comprehensive. Looking
northwards we could see clear over the top of our
giant neighbour, Mount Tasman (11,475 feet). On the
western side, the ocean, but twenty miles distant, was
covered by a mantle of low-lying clouds creeping into
the bays and inlets of the coast, studded here and
there with islanded hill-tops, and stretching away to
what seemed a limitless horizon on the west. A streak
of blue ocean showed through the cloud mantle near
Hokitika, seventy miles northwards.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>North-eastwards the glorious array of the Southern
Alps extended, presenting a panorama of such magnificence
and comprehensiveness that it defies any attempt
at description. It is one of those vast pictures which
are indelibly impressed upon the memory&mdash;one of those
overpowering examples of Nature’s sublimity which
seem to move a man’s very soul and call him to a sense
of his own littleness.</p>

<p>Close under us lay the scenes of all our joys and
sorrows of the past five years: the Tasman Glacier,
encircled by those splendid peaks and snow-fields
whose forms we had learned to know and love so well;
further afield lay the Liebig Range, and, showing over
this, Mount Jukes and his attendant satellites of rocky
peaks. Beyond this again, far, far away in the blue and
indefinite east, we could distinguish the hills of Banks
Peninsula, close to our homes near Christchurch, whilst
we could imagine that the blue haze distinguishable
there was indeed the eastern ocean, 120 miles distant.</p>

<p>It will, of course, be said that we did not make the
complete ascent of the mountain. Be that so; neither
does Mr. Green claim that honour, though for all practical
purposes to be on the ice-cap of Aorangi means
the same thing as being on the top. Mr. Green’s
highest point must, according to his sketches, have
been as nearly as possible 100 feet above ours.</p>

<p>But we could not spare time to moralise and rest as
we should like to have done, for it was imperative that
the terrible ice slopes should be descended before the
light failed, and at a few minutes to six we began to go
down backwards in our steps, taking a firm hold with
our axes at every step.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>This going down is a fearful strain on the nerves,
and requires the greatest steadiness and caution. In
hurrying down the easy rocks we missed a mark on a
snow patch which Dixon had made to denote the right
route, and this mistake at the outset caused us nearly
half an hour’s delay before we found the right spot from
which to leave the crest of the rocks. Dixon led down
the rocks and I followed, every now and then taking
a turn round any prominent projection with the rope
and easing him down, whilst he in turn secured a good
hold and took in the slack as I came down.</p>

<p>Bad as it had been coming up the top <em>couloir</em>, it
was infinitely worse going down, for what was trickling
water on the upward journey was now solid ice, and
many of the steps were filled with re-frozen chips of
ice from the steps we had cut above, and these had
to be cleaned out before we could get a secure foothold.</p>

<p>Cutting steps <i>up</i> is one thing, and cutting them
<i>down</i> another, for on a steep slope one cannot turn
round face downwards to get at one’s work, which in
the case of going up-hill lies convenient to the hand.</p>

<p>How we did get down without the fatal slip which
I was momentarily expecting would be made by one or
the other of us I never could quite understand.</p>

<p>The rocks below the topmost <em>couloir</em> were negotiated
and the lower <em>couloir</em> reached. This was not so
difficult to descend, and the effect of the frost was such
as to prevent such a continual shower of ice blocks
from above, thus minimising one prominent danger.</p>

<p>The lower parts of the <em>couloir</em> were reached, and
here are situated the rocks which form the ledge upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>which with Boss and Kaufmann Mr. Green stood out
for the night. There are several ledges accessible, but
Mr. Green’s party must have been upon one of the
higher, for on some of the lower ledges there is room
for a dozen men to stand or even lie down, though
scarcely space enough for a circus or Wild West show,
as Dixon humorously suggested. The light was now
fast failing, and we strained every nerve to reach the
big <em>bergschrund</em> below before darkness was upon us.</p>

<p>We were just in time and that was all, and the frail
snow bridge was passed by our sliding over on our
backs; I, the lighter man, led, and Dixon followed
as steady as a rock&mdash;not a Mount Cook Rock, but the
proverbial one.</p>

<p>We had now been seventeen hours with every nerve
and muscle constantly in action, and yet, as the darkness
set in and the awful glare of the sun had left us,
we began to freshen up, and lighting one of our
Austrian climbing-lanterns we retraced our footsteps of
the morning, being most careful never to deviate from
them. Soon it became very dark, for there was no
moon, and we could but dimly distinguish the ghostly
forms of the white-robed peaks which shut us in on all
hands.</p>

<p>Hour after hour we plodded on. On one occasion
we were brought up by the crevasse into which Dixon
had nearly fallen in the morning; it had opened wider
during the day, and only after walking along its line
of fracture in both directions for half an hour did we
discover a bridge which seemed sufficiently strong.
We crossed in our usual way, sliding over at full
length, and putting some weight on to our axe-handles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>laid lengthways on the snow to distribute the weight
as much as possible.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, the crust of the snow became
harder, and after passing through that most unpleasant
crusted stage when it will bear until all the weight is
put on one foot, became quite pleasant to walk upon,
and over the lower part of the Linda Glacier and across
the plateau we made a fair pace. As we reached the
rise off the plateau on to the Haast Ridge the wind
increased in violence, and we had great difficulty in
keeping our lanterns (two of which we now kept going)
alight.</p>

<p>The crest of the ridge was gained, and the descent
of the dangerous snow slopes to the bivouac, 1,200
or 1,400 feet below, commenced. We were soon in
trouble again amongst <em>bergschrunds</em> and crevasses, and
on two occasions, in going down and feeling for the
next step behind, I found on showing a light that my
<i>hind</i> leg was dangling in a crevasse!</p>

<p>I must not weary you, dear reader, with further
monotonous descriptions of crossing these deadly
enemies of the mountaineer, suffice it to say that after
an exasperating hunt on the steep slopes and in the
dark for our bivouac&mdash;the candles being just finished&mdash;we
finally discovered it at 2.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, an hour before
daylight, having been twenty-three hours constantly
hard at work without any halt worthy the name.</p>

<p>Sleeping soundly till 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we made up our swags,
and by 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> were on the downward route again for
the Ball Glacier camp.</p>

<p>It was quite a wrench to leave our friendly rock,
which had become a haven of rest and refuge to us on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>this upper beat. Five nights have I spent under its
protection at different times, and as often have I arisen
with the early morn to gaze upon those vast and sublime
solitudes of Nature so grandly unfolded to view.
From this little home&mdash;out of which if one stepped one
had to be careful not to lose one’s footing and make a
rapid descent to the Hochstetter Glacier on one hand
or to the Freshfield on the other&mdash;I have seen the rosy
tints of the newly-born day creep downwards from the
hoary snow-caps of the mountains, and when evening
drew on have watched the afterglow envelop all in
its warm embrace, even black rocks turning to a deep
crimson which seemed to pervade the higher peaks ere
the black and cold night once again grasps them in his
icy hold.</p>

<p>Here had tired limbs been laid to rest whilst wearied
minds dreamed dreams of success and hope, gaining
renewed vigour with the morning light to go forth
afresh into new struggles and enjoyments. Here in the
heart of great Nature’s solitudes the thoughts flew back
to homes of comfort and of love. What wonder that
we should have formed associations with such a spot?</p>

<p>The Ball Glacier camp was reached at 4.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
where we found Mr. Sladden of the Survey party
anxiously awaiting our arrival, with that forethought
which shows the kindly feeling and consideration for
others that characterises men of worth in these outlandish
parts.</p>

<p>That evening Dixon went across with Sladden to
the Survey camp in the Murchison Valley, leaving me
to wait for an expected friend from Christchurch.</p>

<p>Here I was quite alone amongst the mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>with plenty of time to muse over the events of the past
few days and to let my wandering thoughts fly back
even further, to the struggles of the past five years
whilst attempting to conquer Aorangi.</p>

<p>What is the climber’s reward for all his trouble?
Why does he climb? Who can tell?</p>

<p>Is it renown he struggles for? No; I am convinced
that is a very infinitesimal motive. For mercenary
ends? No; there is no financial harvest to reap.</p>

<p>I have often tried to think why men undergo such
labour and hardship, but cannot come to any definite
conclusion. To overcome set tasks (‘pure cussedness’
the Americans would say) is one reason (after once
putting one’s hand to the plough). To gain physical
and mental strength, to raise and purify the mind in
Nature’s great school, are both potent reasons. But,
above all, there is some mysterious influence pervading
all true mountaineers&mdash;a mountain fever, a close kinship
with Nature (call it what you will), a hidden
impulse that grows on a man who has once felt what it
is to taste the sweets of climbing and to enjoy the
fascinations of the world above the snow-line.</p>

<p>My friend did not arrive, so I made my way over
to Mr. Brodrick’s Survey camp on the Murchison,
walking through a thick mist, and steering across the
Tasman by the aid of a compass&mdash;a distance of seven
miles, or three hours’ walking from camp to camp.</p>

<p>Here I found Cooper&mdash;Messrs. Wheeler &amp; Son’s
photographic operator&mdash;who was down securing views
of the district for a lecture which I was to deliver
before the Australasian Association for the Advancement
of Science.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>It was our intention to make a two days’ excursion
up the Murchison Glacier with Cooper, but showery
weather put a veto on our plans, and we were fain to
be content with a short excursion to the Onslow Glacier,
where some exposures were effected.</p>

<p>Leaving Mr. Brodrick’s hospitable quarters on
December 10, by the 12th we were again at the
Hermitage.</p>

<small>ON SOME OF THE PHENOMENA OF GLACIERS, WITH SPECIAL
REGARD TO THOSE OF NEW ZEALAND</small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a work of this nature it may not be out of place to
briefly describe some of those interesting features and
phenomena which accompany the world above the snow-line.</p>

<p>Here is a quotation from a recent review of Professor
Heim’s work<a name="fnanchor_2_2" id="fnanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by a prominent member of the
English Alpine Club:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Some thirty years ago a systematic <em>résumé</em> of all
that was known up to that date about existing glaciers
appeared in the work of Professor Albert Mousson,
“<cite>Die Gletscher der Jetztzeit</cite>,” since which, with perhaps
the exception of Major Hüber’s “Les Glaciers,” no
attempt has been made to collect into a focus the light
which numerous able observers and theorists have
subsequently thrown upon the question. The intricacy
of the problem has, indeed, increased almost in proportion
to our enlarged knowledge of its conditions; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>in spite of the labours of a large and very distinguished
body of investigators, not only do many important
points remain matters of dispute, but the very materials
for a complete solution are still wanting.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#fnanchor_2_2">[2]</a> <i>Handbuch der Gletscherkunde</i>, von Dr. Albert Heim, Zürich (Stuttgart:
Verlag von J. Engelhorn, 1885, 18 francs.)</p></div>

<p class="center space-above">CAUSE OF GLACIERS</p>

<p>The joint cause of glaciers is precipitation and cold.
A low temperature alone can do nothing without
moisture, and this fact quickly disposes of the popular
notion that glaciers invariably exist in cold countries.
Thibet, for instance, and also some parts of Arctic
North America are destitute of ice streams, though
eternal cold may be said to reign supreme in these parts.</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment the higher mountains clear
of snow and ice, and then watch for the formation of a
glacier. Snow falls and fills up all the valleys and
gullies, avalanches descend from the higher parts,
and a great accumulation gathers in all hollows. By
constant repetition of snow-falls (always provided a
greater quantity is deposited than can be melted by the
sun’s rays and by the natural warmth of the earth’s crust)
great pressure is put upon the lower portions by the
superincumbent accumulation, and aided by the infiltration
of water and refreezing (or ‘regelation’ as the
correct term is), a large body of ice is formed which at
once begins to move down the valleys containing it.</p>

<p class="center space-above">GLACIER ICE</p>

<p>Glacier ice is not like the solid blue ice on the surface
of water, but consists of granules joined together
by an intricate network of capillary water-filled fissures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>In exposed sections and upon the surface of the ice
can be observed a ‘veined’ or ‘banded’ structure&mdash;veins
of a denser blue colour alternating with those of
a lighter shade containing air bubbles.</p>

<p>The cause of this peculiar structure has been the
subject of much theorising amongst investigators, but
hitherto I believe the greatest authorities consider that
the explanation of the phenomenon is yet wanting.</p>

<p class="center space-above">GLACIER MOTION</p>

<p>The motion of glaciers is yet another bone of contention,
but it is generally admitted that the cause of
it is to be found mainly in gravitation, and is also
partially accounted for by the strange property of
‘viscosity’ in what appears to the casual observer to
be nothing more or less than a rigid solid.</p>

<p>Recently observations for ascertaining the rate of
progress of the Tasman, Murchison, Hooker, and Mueller
Glaciers have been made by the New Zealand Government
Survey Department. Some of the results were
embodied in a paper by Mr. J. H. Baker, the Chief
Surveyor of the Provincial District of Canterbury, and
will appear in the ‘Transactions of the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science’ for 1891.
At the late meeting of that body a committee was appointed
to further these investigations, and a sum of
25<abbr title="litres">l.</abbr> voted for the aid of the same.</p>

<p>Before long, therefore, there will be put before the
scientific public reliable measurements of the motion of
several of the largest and least-known glaciers in
temperate regions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above">MORAINES</p>

<p>There is a remarkable feature of the glaciers of this
country which stamps them as unique in one respect&mdash;I
refer to the very extensive moraines. I write feelingly
of this, for my acquaintance with them has been a very
close one, and they have impressed me very deeply&mdash;in
more ways than one.</p>

<p>The large glaciers of which I have written in this
work are completely moraine-covered over their lower
parts.</p>

<p class="center space-above">‘SURFACE’ MORAINES</p>

<p>Moraines may be divided into four sections:
‘Lateral’ moraines, fringing the sides of the glaciers,
their outlying portions often being ‘dead’&mdash;that is, at
present unmoved by the action of the ice, and forming
banks, as it were, for the ice stream to flow between;
‘medial’ moraines, which begin at the junction of two
streams of ice and often continue for many miles to
the terminal face; ‘terminal’ moraines, formed by
the depositing of detritus at the melting point or end
of the glacier; and, lastly, ‘surface’ moraines (so called
by Professor Hutton of Christchurch, N.Z.), which are
the combined accumulations of the first two divisions
in the lower parts of the glacier.</p>

<p>It is these ‘surface’ moraines that are such a characteristic
feature of the glaciers situate on the eastern
side of the chain in New Zealand. Of those on the
western side I am not able to speak with authority,
never having visited them myself; but I understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>that they do not carry such a large quantity of detritus
as those of the eastern slopes.</p>

<p>This disparity remains to be accounted for and
awaits an explanation. I have a theory of my own
upon the subject, which, however, as yet I would not
like to put too strongly forward.</p>

<p>On both sides of Mount Cook, on Mount De la Bêche (ten miles further
along the chain), and on a peak just north of the Hochstetter Dome (ten
miles still further north) I have observed enormous exposed sections of
the rock strata, which in each case dip at a steep angle <em>from east
to west</em>, presenting slab faces, not easily disturbed by the action
of the frost, to the westward, but broken and fast denuding faces
(‘basset’ faces, as they are geologically termed) to the eastward. I
am hoping at some future time to further investigate this interesting
subject.</p>

<p>As the western glaciers, however, must descend steeper valleys than the
eastern, I make no doubt that their rate of progress will be eventually
ascertained to be greater than that of the latter, and this would
militate largely against an accumulation of moraine <em>upon the ice</em>.</p>

<p class="center space-above">THE SURFACE OF A GLACIER</p>

<p>All sorts of queer notions as to what the surface of
a glacier is like exist. Indeed I have often heard
people inquire if it would be possible <i>to skate upon it</i>!</p>

<p>Let us for a moment imagine ourselves at the head
of the great Tasman Glacier, 8,600 feet above sea-level.
All around us is snow, either freshly fallen or merging
into <em>névé</em>. We begin to walk down, and at first, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>the steeper slopes, cross a few large crevasses and
<em>bergschrunds</em> by means of snow bridges; then, as the
incline becomes less steep, we walk for six miles or so
upon a smooth surface of <em>névé</em>, or perchance knee-deep
in fresh snow, and scarcely a crevasse exists. At
the beginning of the great turn we gradually leave
the <em>névé</em> and find ourselves upon hard, white ice, and
soon transverse crevasses appear; these are a little
further on cut by longitudinal crevasses forming the
surface into huge squares, not flat on the top, but hummocky.
A perfect network of crevasses cuts up the
whole of the surface, but those parts on the outside of
the curve are infinitely more disturbed than those on the
inside, owing to the tension put upon them by the faster
rate at which they have to move. After rounding the
turn the glacier again consolidates and few crevasses
appear, only the surface is covered with old wounds&mdash;if
I may coin such a term&mdash;from the rents which have
occurred at the turn, and presents a very undulating
appearance. The little gullies are formed into watercourses
and intersect the glacier in all directions. On
our right, now, is the medial moraine formed by detritus
from Mount De la Bêche, brought down partly by the
Tasman and partly by the Rudolf Glaciers, and it
stands up 100 feet or so above the surface of the clear
ice on either side of it, owing to the protection from
the sun’s rays afforded by it to the ice beneath, so preventing
‘ablation’ or waste going on so quickly. We
follow down for another four or five miles, and then
cross this moraine (which has in the meantime joined
that on the northern side of the Hochstetter Glacier)
on to the Hochstetter on our right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p class="center space-above">SURFACE TORRENTS AND MOULINS</p>

<p>We are now immediately below the great ice-fall,
and the surface of the glacier presents an appearance
not unlike the back of some enormous caterpillar
wrinkled transversely by crevasses, which close up as
we proceed downwards, and furrowed longitudinally
by two large or main watercourses whose icy banks
are in places 100 feet above their respective torrents.
These two small rivers are fed from every direction by
minor watercourses, and a mile or two further down
discharge all their contents into crevasses and <em>moulins</em>,
or water-shafts in the ice.</p>

<p class="center space-above">GLACIER TABLES AND CONES&mdash;THE ACTION OF WARMTH</p>

<p>The locality of the glacier on which we now are is
very interesting, for Nature’s mills are here seen at work
day by day. Glacier tables&mdash;blocks of rock perched
upon pedestals of ice formed by the protection from the
action of the sun’s warmth&mdash;are of frequent occurrence.
Glacier cones&mdash;heaps of sand and small fragments of
rock raised by a similar agency (after having been
washed to one spot by water)&mdash;are in places all around
us. Then, strange and contradictory as it may seem,
we see thousands of holes, each with a stone at the
bottom and filled with the bluest of blue water, formed
also in the first place by the rays of the sun warming
the stone and causing it to sink in the ice. It is well-known
in physics that water at 39° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> is at its heaviest,
and as soon as the warm stone&mdash;the dark colour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>stone having absorbed more heat than the surrounding
ice&mdash;begins to sink the warmer water follows it, whilst
that in the neighbouring temperature of 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> rises
to the surface and becomes in its turn re-warmed, and
so on. This peculiar current often bores the holes in
the ice to a depth of many feet, and is only checked
by a preponderance of cold. It is the larger stones,
therefore, which rise upon the ice, and the smaller ones
which sink.</p>

<p class="center space-above">‘SURFACE’ AND ‘TERMINAL’ MORAINES</p>

<p>We walk on down the ice stream, and soon the
moraines on either hand close in upon us and we find
ourselves on a mere wedge of ice, at the point of which
we step on to the ‘surface’ moraine. Here the swearing
begins, and it lasts right on to the terminal face
four or five miles below, for it is one continual repetition
of walking on loose and tumbling rocks, up one hillock,
along a ridge, jumping from</p>

<p class="center">Rock to rock with many a shock,</p>

<p class="noindent">down another hillock, now and then starting a whole
avalanche of many-sided and sharp-edged stones down
a treacherous slope of ice, which we take for a surface
deeply covered and sound of footing.</p>

<p>Skate on the surface of a glacier?</p>

<p>‘Not much!’ (as the Colonials say).</p>

<p class="center space-above">AVALANCHES</p>

<p>Very strange notions also exist amongst the uninitiated
as to the nature of avalanches. The popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>idea of an avalanche is derived from heartrending
accounts of great sweepings away and annihilation of
whole villages, and few of the general run of people
seem to realise that in Alpine work almost any little
descending mass of rock, snow, or ice is dignified by
the name of avalanche. Snow avalanches are most frequent
after fresh falls of snow followed immediately by
warm weather, and after a little experience amongst the
mountains one soon learns to detect their customary
tracks. Ice avalanches are mainly caused through the
overhanging portion of ice at the terminals of secondary
glaciers&mdash;that is, glaciers which break off before descending
to the valley or to the parent glacier below. The
tracks of ice avalanches are almost invariably unmistakable
and are swept night and day without cessation,
and very frequently at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Rock avalanches are more treacherous, and one
never knows when to expect them from above; generally
in the early morning the frost holds the stones above
in an icy grip, but as the sun melts the ice in the
chinks the hold is released and a stone will descend
into the <em>couloirs</em> or ditches which scarp the mountain
side. If one happens to be below then it is a case of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i> and a rush for the nearest protection, for
there is no saying how many tons, or indeed how many
hundreds of tons, of loose rocks or stone may start in a
wild and dusty rattle down the hillside.</p>

<p>But some snow avalanches almost crawl down the
<em>couloirs</em>, and make a strange and ever-continued hissing
as they move. These are composed of heavy and
sodden snow, and begin after the sun has been up for
some hours, continuing until nightfall. These are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>so dangerous on a gentle slope, and one can often
waddle or half glissade down in the midst of one with
perfect safety, though they make one uncomfortably
wet.</p>

<p class="center space-above">CORNICES</p>

<p>Cornices are a frequent source of danger to the
mountaineer. They are formed by the snow drifting
over one edge of a ridge and forming a hanging mass.
It is needless to say that one soon learns to walk some
feet away from the outer edge of a cornice, for after
poking one’s axe-handle through three feet of snow,
and peeping through a blue hole down a precipice of
perhaps 1,000 feet or so, it is not difficult to fancy
what the result would be should the cornice break.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI</abbr><br />
<small>CANOEING ON THE NEW ZEALAND RIVERS</small></h2>

<p class="hang50center"><i>The Waimakariri</i>&mdash;<i>The enormous rainfall</i>&mdash;<i>Descent of the Waitaki
River</i>&mdash;<i>The Tasman branch</i>&mdash;<i>Lake Pukaki</i>&mdash;<i>Leaky canoes</i>&mdash;<i>The
Pukaki Rapids</i>&mdash;<i>The Waitaki Gorge</i>&mdash;<i>Out on the plains again</i>&mdash;<i>Sixty
miles’ paddle to catch the train</i>&mdash;<i>Home once more</i></p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Canoeing</span> on the New Zealand rivers is desperately
exciting work. On the west coast of the South Island
there is a canoe club, whose members build boats in
watertight compartments specially suited for the rough
journeys which they undertake. Some of these men
are adepts at canoe-sailing, and think little of going out
to sea in their cockle-shells and even making long coastal
journeys. The brothers Park have established quite a
reputation by their adventurous journeyings. On one
occasion they crossed the South Island with their canoes,
towing up the Teramakau River, crossing a saddle of
1,700 feet at its head, descending the Hurunui and
then coasting fifty miles down to Christchurch. On
another occasion the crossing of Cook Straits was
effected by them.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the island not much canoeing
has been done, with the exception of the navigation of
two of the largest rivers (the Waimakariri and Waitaki)
from their sources to the sea by Mr. Dixon and myself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>I well remember how universal was the outcry
against our attempting to descend the Waimakariri in
1889, upon which occasion we conveyed the canoes
up to the head waters in the Southern Alps, and came
down ninety miles of rapids at a tremendous rate,
going through the celebrated gorge fourteen miles in
length. Dixon reached Christchurch in one day&mdash;a
wonderful feat&mdash;but I was not able to accomplish more
than half the distance, and took two days over it. This
involved a descent of 2,550 feet in altitude from the
starting point.</p>

<p>In the following year the Waimakariri was again
navigated by myself and three other kindred adventurous
spirits, when a number of line photographic views
of the scenery in the gorge were secured.</p>

<p>The descent of the Waitaki River, however, promised
some exciting work, in addition to giving a grand insight
into the story of the ancient glacier formation&mdash;a
subject of great geological interest.</p>

<p>The rainfall in the New Zealand mountain districts
is enormously heavy, as much or more than 150 inches
per annum being registered in some parts. The rivers
consequently carry a phenomenal amount of water for
their length, and the calculations as to their discharge
give wonderful results. The Clutha River in Otago&mdash;the
largest river of the South Island&mdash;discharges as
much water per annum as the Nile! It seems a strange
statement to make; but such is the fact, the calculations
having been made by competent men.</p>

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The day following our return from Aorangi we left
the Hermitage at 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and by 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> had begun our
exciting journey of 140 miles to the sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The Tasman River takes its rise from the Tasman
and Murchison Glaciers, and is soon joined by the
Hooker, which drains the Hooker and Mueller Glaciers.
Its course from Mount Cook to its delta at the head of
Lake Pukaki is thirty miles in length, and the fall is
considerable, the terminal face of the Tasman Glacier
being 2,456 feet above sea-level, whilst the altitude of
Lake Pukaki is 1,717 feet. The first mile or two of
the journey was marked by several strong rapids, and
we could not avoid shipping much water; and, added
to this, we soon found that some old cracks in the
canoes had opened out through exposure to the sun,
although they had been carefully covered over with
sacking during our absence in the mountains. This
gave us some cause for anxiety, and the discomfort
of paddling in boats which were half full of water
soon made itself painfully apparent. Indeed, there is
nothing more calculated to put a man out of temper
with all the world and his surroundings, to goad him
to strong language, and to give him an uncomfortable
and miserable time generally, than to have to sit for
hours in a boat that floats like an unmanageable log, to
say nothing of the increase of danger to which he is
consequently exposed in some parts of a river such as
the Tasman, running, as it does, something approaching
ten knots in many places.</p>

<p>I don’t think Dixon and myself are likely to forget
the tortures of the four hours which we passed through
on reaching the lake. Here the cracks in my boat,
which was decidedly the worse of the two, had to be
jammed up with handkerchiefs, &amp;c., before we dared
to venture on a journey of eight or nine miles to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>ferry at the other end of the lake, where is situated
the exit of the Pukaki River.</p>

<p>As we scraped over the sandy shallows and pushed
off into deep-green water, my heart sank within me at
the idea of having to cross the lake in its present
rough state (for a strong nor’-wester was blowing) in
our frail canoes, which were not built in watertight
compartments, and were quite unsuited for the work.
Every ten minutes or so I would have to stop paddling
and bale for dear life with the lid of the ‘billy,’ and the
craft would immediately swing round broadside on to
the seas, which seemed to do their best to upset her.</p>

<p>At first we kept edging away for the southern
shore, and about half-way down the lake succeeded in
getting within reasonable swimming distance, which, to
a certain extent, we retained for a short time.</p>

<p>In the distance we could make out the island close
to the ferry, with some trees on it, and from our direction
there appeared to be but three. My thoughts at
once flew back to the island on the Lake of Geneva,
which Byron has immortalised in his ‘Prisoner of
Chillon,’ and on which poor Bonnivard would gaze
with sadness and yearning for freedom and life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>I made sure my hair would be grey, like poor
Bonnivard’s, before this lake was crossed; but soon the
wind dropped, and we paddled ashore at 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> close
to the hotel and called for brandy and water hot, and
seldom was the indulgence more justified.</p>

<p>At Pukaki Ferry we enjoyed a well-earned night’s
rest, and on Sunday morning we effected repairs to the
leaky canoes, in which operation we received much
valuable advice and assistance from Mr. John Gibb,
artist, who was spending a few days in sketching at
this point. By 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we were on board again and
looking forward to reaching Rugged Ridges&mdash;Mr. W.
G. Rutherfurd’s station on the southern bank of the
Waitaki&mdash;before nightfall. But we little knew what
was ahead of us.</p>

<p>A survey of the river from an eminence of the old
moraine through which it has formed a channel, revealed,
as far as the bends of the stream could be
followed, a rushing, seething mass of foam-covered
water, with numberless blocks of rock barring the
clear passage of the current, and though we shot the
first two rapids below the exit from the lake it took
us until seven o’clock in the evening to navigate six
miles of the river’s course.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe the wild course of the
river in its descent through the enormous ancient
moraine deposits, some of which might almost be
classed as mountains, and must rear their tops to a
height of 1,000 feet above the level of the river. Such
an immense body of rushing water, receiving, as it does,
the whole of the drainage of the Southern Alps, from
the head of the Mueller Glacier to that of the Murchi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>son,
necessarily creates great havoc amongst the
glacial and fluviatile deposits through which it descends,
and, as a matter of course, all the smaller
stones are hurried and rolled along to form shingle on
the river-beds further down, leaving the larger ones,
which alone can stand against the force of the flood.
The natural consequence is a stream of the most
broken and impetuous character, a stream whose rushing,
roaring, and foaming drowns all sounds contiguous
to it; rapid after rapid of seemingly tempest-tossed
and crested billows, of whirlpools and eddies, of back-waters
and heavings into surface currents, and never a
still pool to be found anywhere.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, the troubles of two canoeists in navigating
this stretch of water. No canoe or boat in the
world would have the slightest chance of going through,
out in the current, without being smashed into match-wood
and its occupants infallibly drowned, for swimming
would avail a man nothing in such a place.</p>

<p>All we could do, then, was to keep close to the bank
and let our frail boats down by the tow-lines amongst
the rocks in the comparatively shallow water. Now
shoving them off into a fair stretch and hauling them
up short in time to avoid contact with some ugly rock
in front, then scrambling along ourselves and coiling
our lines as we advanced, clambering over water-worn
and slippery rocks, tearing our way through the Wild
Irishman scrub, or wading a few steps middle-deep in
the turbid water to the points where we had brought
our respective canoes up. Then repeating the same
performance over again and again, bruising our legs
against rocks, slipping down amid the slimy stones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>scratching the skin off and receiving numerous thorns
from the scrub, wishing we had never been born,
lamenting the hardships of our lot, anathematising
canoes, ropes, paddles, river, rocks, scrub, and everything
in creation.</p>

<p>No, that seven miles journey was <i>not</i> all that could
be desired; but having put our hands to the plough,
we both made up our minds that we would go through
with the undertaking, even if we had to repeat the
same performance down to the sea every day for a
week, and the worse the river got the more pig-headed
we became. We had beaten Mount Cook, and we
meant also to gain a victory over the Pukaki and
Waitaki, if it cost us our life-blood. At some places
where a number of large rocks were congregated close
to the river’s bank we would be compelled to take the
boats out, and shouldering them, climb round the rocks
on shore, and launch them afresh in better water
below.</p>

<p>At one time, Dixon, who was leading, accidentally
dropped his paddle, which was whisked away by the
current in a trice. He made a great effort to recover
it, and plunged in up to his armpits in the turbulent
water, but failed to reach the truant paddle. Seeing
his difficulty I pushed my boat out to him, and he
seized my paddle and, jumping into the canoe, gave
chase to the one he had lost. I ran along the bank, but
could not keep near him; and in fear and trembling I
watched him nearing a horrible fall amongst some
sharp teeth-like rocks. I thought his last moment had
come, but just before reaching the danger he overtook
the lost paddle, which he grasped with one hand, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>jumping out of my canoe, held the tow-rope and
brought the boat up within a few feet of the fall. The
whole affair was the work of a few moments, and was a
wonderful exhibition of smartness and presence of mind.</p>

<p>By 7 o’clock we began to think that we had had
about enough for the day, and, putting the boats
ashore, we walked back, over the old moraine and
along the rabbit fence (which, by the way, I hear is
doing its work splendidly), to the Pukaki Ferry for
the night.</p>

<p>By 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> next morning we were again with the
canoes, and once more performing gymnastic feats
along the rocky bank. But our reward was now near
at hand, for after an hour or so we got on board and
sneaked down the quieter sides of one or two pools.
The moraine deposits gave way to those of fluviatile
origin, and the size of the stones in the river-bed decreased
rapidly; consequently we soon began shooting
the rapids again and were making grand headway.
The country on either hand opened out; from our left
came in the Tekapo River, and soon after, as we sped
on under Ben More, on our right the Ohau. Now we
were in the Waitaki, which is formed by the junction
of these three rivers. ‘Waitaki,’ or ‘Waitangi,’ means
‘Crying water.’</p>

<p>The hydrographic area of the Waitaki Basin is
4,914 square miles, more than three times as great as
that of the Rakaia or Waimakariri, and it drains most
of the principal eastern slopes of the Southern Alps.</p>

<p>The eastern source of the river drains the Godley
and Classen Glaciers with their numerous tributaries,
forms the Godley River, and flows into Lake Tekapo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>(some fifteen miles in length); it issues from the southern
end of the Lake and curves a channel for itself through
the ancient moraine, when it becomes known by the name
of the Tekapo River, which, flowing for a distance of
about twenty-five miles, joins the Pukaki; all these,
with the addition of the Ohau, the junction of which is
a few miles further down, form the Waitaki River. The
Hopkins and Dobson Rivers drain that part of the Alps
immediately south-west of Mount Sefton, and flow into
Lake Ohau. The stream issuing from thence, under the
name of the Ohau River, runs for a course of thirteen
miles, and joins the Pukaki and Tekapo as before
mentioned.</p>

<p>After the union of these three systems of drainage
the course of the river runs through a wider bed for
about five or six miles before entering a gorge some
ten miles in length. Down this fine stretch of water
we now enjoyed a delightful paddle, and soon we sighted
Black Forest sheep station, with its rows of green
willow trees, on our left.</p>

<p>Here various kinds of river birds lent an aspect of
life and gaiety to the scene&mdash;gulls, terns, paradise and
grey duck, teal, dotterel, stilt, and red-bill soared over
us, or rose in startled dismay as we shot by.</p>

<p>We had left the snows behind us and were fast
being closed in by the foot-hills. We neared the gorge
at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and paddled ashore on the Otago side and
boiled the ‘billy’ for lunch.</p>

<p>It seemed a delightfully quiet hour after all we had
been through; we sat and smoked in happiness and
watching the rabbits skipping about amongst the
bracken. We were certain, if only by that, that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>were in Otago, where rabbits are the monarchs of all
they survey.</p>

<p>The Mackenzie country hands had told us that we
should find the gorge <i>a little rough</i>, so we knew we
were in for it presently; yet for a couple of miles we
found the river good going, though some ominous spurs
of bed rock now and then entering the current&mdash;the
first bed rock we had met with since leaving Mount
Cook&mdash;foretold what we were coming to.</p>

<p>After going round a few ugly corners the white
water became more frequent, until suddenly we were
brought up by an awkward rapid into which we dared
not venture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i_128fp.jpg" id="i_128fp.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_128fp.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="447" />

  <p class="attr-photo">[<i>Wheeler &amp; Son, Photo.</i></p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>A survey from the cliffs, sixty feet above the stream,
disclosed a tongue or groyn of rocks running out into
the stream in an oblique direction from the Otago side,
and shooting the main body of the current on to the
rocks opposite. A long stretch of straight water
followed, but the whole stream was confined in rocky
banks so close together that one might throw a biscuit
across, and the pace of the current was something
terrific. For half an hour we considered the situation,
finally determining to shoot the rapid. There was
really only about eight or ten feet of safe water close
to the point of the groyn of rocks, and this was right
in the body of the current. On either hand were
eddies and whirlpools of the most formidable character,
which, in the event of our making a bad shot, might
swirl us among the rocks on one side or the other, and
had such been the case we trembled to think what
would have been our fate. However, at it we went,
Dixon as usual leading, with a head as cool as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>cucumber, and I following, like a spaniel after his
master. One wild rush, a few strokes of the paddle, a
mad tossing about in a sheet of crested foam, half-a-dozen
bucketfuls of water on board, and we were
through, breathing again as we tore down the hurrying,
but straight and safe, current below.</p>

<p>Though we met with no greater obstacles to canoeing
than this rapid in the gorge, such performances
were several times repeated, and we had to land now
and again to survey the course ahead.</p>

<p>To describe the mad plunging of the river through
the gorge is not an easy matter. Here and there, perhaps,
a long even stretch is met with, but for the most
part the river makes a succession of bends bounded by
rocky cliffs on either hand, now and then masses of rock
crop up through the water, against which the stream
is banked up by the force of its mad career to a height
of ten or twelve feet; immediately under the sides
of the rock there are vicious-looking heavings, eddies,
and whirlpools, which, if one chances to get into them,
twist the boat about like a feather when blown upon
the water’s surface. A black swan and three cygnets
kept ahead of us for the last six miles of the gorge, but
as we entered with relieved feelings upon the more open
country, they eluded our further pursuit in a backwater.
Another few miles and we reached our destination for
the night&mdash;Mr. W. G. Rutherfurd’s station, Rugged
Ridges&mdash;where a warm and hospitable welcome made us
feel that once more we were in the regions of civilisation.</p>

<p>Leaving next morning at 4.30, we gave ourselves
eleven hours to catch the train for Christchurch, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Waitaki, a distance by water of sixty miles. Four
hours saw us in Duntroon (thirty miles), where we
astonished the natives in disgracefully tattered boating
attire, and indulged in that from which we had long
been estranged&mdash;‘a long shandy’&mdash;and by 9.15 we
were off again at eight miles an hour, shooting down
the most beautifully safe and rippling rapids, scaring
ducks, plover, gull, stilt, swan, and all manner of wild
fowl; now and then startling a mob of horses or cattle
from their peaceful browsing, or astonishing some slow-going
shepherd or cowboy as they stared open-mouthed
at such an uncommon sight as two madmen in cockle-shells
of canoes rushing down their boatless river,
until we put the final touch to the whole enterprise by
carrying our boats up to the station at Waitaki South
(to the amazement of four railway navvies), at 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
having averaged eight miles an hour for sixty miles,
allowing for one hour stoppages.</p>

<p>The distances by water, allowing for sinuosities in
the course of the rivers from Aorangi to the sea, may
be roughly summarised as follows:&mdash;From the end of
the Mount Cook Range to Pukaki Ferry, thirty-four
miles; from the Ferry to Rugged Ridges, thirty-eight
miles; and from thence to the railway bridge near the sea
at Waitaki, sixty miles; a total distance of 132 miles.</p>

<p>If it were not for the Pukaki Rapids the trip
might be comfortably accomplished in three days, and
at a stretch could be done in two; but the way to
enjoy it would be to travel in a good staunch canoe,
with watertight compartments and such accessories as
the west coast canoeists are in the habit of using, and
spend a week over the journey.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been suggested to me that this work would be more
complete if it contained at least a short record of Alpine expeditions
undertaken by parties (other than those organised by the
writer) to the glacier regions which have been under notice.
The suggestion is one which the writer accepts with much
pleasure.</p>

<p>The first recorded expedition to the Mount Cook district, as
far as I am able to gather, is that of the late Sir Julius von
Haast (then Dr. von Haast), the narrative of which may be
found in his interesting and learned work ‘<cite>The Geology of
Canterbury and Westland</cite>,’ published by the ‘Times’ office of
Christchurch, now unfortunately out of print, and difficult of
access to the majority.</p>

<p>His work was necessarily more that of exploration than of
climbing, and although later surveys have corrected and modified
many of his estimates of the sizes of glaciers and heights of
mountains, it must be remembered that in the days when he
visited the locality (in 1862 and 1870) the difficulties of
travelling and of securing supplies were much greater than at
the present time, and the work of exploration consequently
much more difficult.</p>

<p>Of Alpine work (carried on in the sense of the word as
understood by Alpine climbers) he did not effect much, his
energies being chiefly confined to geological, botanical, and
zoological observations whilst he was engaged in a geological
survey of the province of Canterbury.</p>

<p>His excursions on the glaciers appear to have been confined
to a short trip up the Tasman, probably to some six miles or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>so from the terminal face, and a short exploration of the lower
portions of the Mueller and Hooker Glaciers.</p>

<p>His literary contributions are of greater value to science than
to the domain of Alpine record; but naturally they are of the
deepest interest to the latter class of literature, inasmuch as
they tell the tale of the opening out of fresh Alpine fields which
are destined to become&mdash;indeed they are now fast becoming&mdash;areas
of great mountaineering importance.</p>

<p>Though Von Haast was perhaps the first man of science or
literature to visit these great glaciers, yet their existence was
well known to a few run-holders and early settlers who had
penetrated even thus far into the mountains in the ‘early days’
of New Zealand.</p>

<p>It is to Mr. Edward Percy Sealy of Timaru, however, that
we owe the first close acquaintance of the Mueller, Hooker, and
Tasman Glaciers. Mr. Sealy was a surveyor by profession and
a photographer of no mean ability, and to his energy and perseverance
we are indebted for results which furnished Dr. von
Haast with material for constructing his map of this part of our
Alps.</p>

<p>Upon visiting the glaciers at the present time, and being
impressed with the difficulties of transit, one cannot but be
filled with admiration for the man who achieved such splendid
results in photography, burdened as he was with all the necessary
and cumbersome paraphernalia pertaining to the old wet-plate
system then in vogue.</p>

<p>Mr. Sealy traversed nearly the whole length of the Mueller
Glacier in 1867, and in 1869 pushed his way up the Hooker as
far as the tributary Empress Glacier, and up the Tasman as far
as the great turn at Mount De la Bêche.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Leonard Harper, of Ilam, belongs the honour of being
the first lady to cross to the Aorangi side of the Tasman River.</p>

<p>On this occasion (in March 1873) the party consisted of
Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Harper, of Christchurch, Messrs. G.
Dennistoun, G. Parker, Melville Gray, Wright, C. Smith, and
Flint. They camped at Governor’s Bush, close to where the
Hermitage now stands, and went on to the Mueller Glacier and
to the terminal face of the Tasman. Mr. and Mrs. Harper re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>turned
across the Tasman River, leaving the rest of the party to
attempt the passage to the west coast by the Hooker Saddle, at
the head of the glacier of the same name. In this, as may
be easily conceived&mdash;considering that the members of the party
were inexperienced and not properly equipped for such an expedition&mdash;the
party was unsuccessful, only reaching a point just
above where the clear ice merges into the moraine, and where
the crevasses began to appear formidable.</p>

<p>For many years after this the glaciers were not traversed
to any extent save by camping-out parties, who contented themselves
with short excursions about the terminal faces, until, in
1882, a fresh interest was awakened in their existence by the
visit of the Rev. W. S. Green with Herr Emil Boss, of Grindelwald,
and Ulrich Kaufmann as guide. His advent was indeed
an awakening, and the apathy of the Colonials regarding the
scenic marvels of their own country was somewhat aroused.
The sensation caused by his memorable ascent of Aorangi, after
repeated struggles with flooded rivers and all those hindrances
which seem to fall inevitably to the lot of men who first open
out a new district, has become quite an event of history in the
annals of the colony.</p>

<p>Full particulars of Mr. Green’s doings will be found in his
admirable book, ‘<cite>The High Alps of New Zealand</cite>,’ published by
Macmillan &amp; Co.</p>

<p>To Mr. Green undoubtedly belongs the honour of having
first introduced into New Zealand the proper system of Alpine
climbing, and he will ever be looked back to as the father of
the noble sport in the colony.</p>

<p>Then, in 1883, followed the visit of Dr. R. von Lendenfeld, a
mountaineer and scientific man of great attainments. He was
accompanied by his plucky wife, and, aided by porters procured
in the colony, during a stay of nineteen days on the Tasman
Glacier completed a survey of the same, and finished up his
work by ascending the Hochstetter Dome, whose higher and
easternmost summit he attained in an expedition extending
over a period of twenty-seven hours from his last camp under
the Malte Brun range, accompanied by his wife and one porter.</p>

<p>Full particulars of his work were made public in Petermann’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>‘Mitteilungen,’<a name="fnanchor_3_3" id="fnanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and a short English notice of the same may
be found in the ‘Alpine Journal,’ vol. xii. page 163.</p>

und seine Umgebung</i>.</p></div>

<p>Shortly after this the Hermitage Company, Limited, was
formed, and the Hermitage Hotel erected near the terminal
face of the Mueller Glacier. This first Alpine hotel of New
Zealand was not built without many serious difficulties, and
the ultimate success of the undertaking speaks volumes for the
perseverance of the enthusiastic manager, Mr. F. F. C. Huddleston.
This gentleman has made various excursions on the
Mueller and Hooker Glaciers since the building of the Hermitage,
and possesses an intimate knowledge of the Alpine district
around the hotel. He has, with a party of two others, penetrated,
I understand, as far as the junction of the Empress Glacier on
the Hooker, and has since effected the passage of the Ball Pass
from the Tasman to the Hooker Glaciers.</p>

<p>In 1886 the author began his visits to the districts with
properly equipped Alpine parties, the results of which expeditions
have been given in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Government surveys were extended to the
Mueller and Hooker Glaciers, under Mr. Brodrick, a gentleman
whose capability and never-failing pluck in carrying out his
work in such rough country is only equalled by his modesty
concerning his Alpine achievements, which are necessarily
incidental to his profession in the district.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who are acquainted with survey and
topographical work amongst the Alps will appreciate the results
of but two seasons’ work in the map of the four great glaciers
appended to this book. Climbers will be interested to know
that amongst difficult points attained by Mr. Brodrick are the
saddles at the head of the Mueller Glacier, that connecting the
Murchison and Classen Glaciers, the lower summit of the Hochstetter
Dome, and a peak of 8,015 feet on the Liebig Range.</p>

<p>In 1890, Mr. Malcolm Ross, of Dunedin, a gentleman
who has done much travelling and some exploring in the
Southern Lakes district, and had tried his ’prentice hand upon
Mount Earnslaw, visited the Tasman Glacier in company with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>his wife. Bad weather frustrated his attempts at mountaineering,
with the exception of an ascent of a peak of about 7,000
feet on the Mount Cook Range, and a partial ascent of Mount
Sealy. He traversed the Tasman Glacier to a point some miles
beyond the junction of the Hochstetter Glacier.</p>

<p>In December 1890 Messrs. A. P. Harper, R. Blakiston, and
Beadel made an excursion to the Tasman Glacier, but bad
weather kept them prisoners at camp nearly all the time of their
stay. Messrs. Harper and Blakiston, after retreating from the
Tasman, succeeded in reaching for the first time the saddle at
the head of the Hooker Glacier (8,580 feet), after a trying expedition.
This had been attempted several times before, but
owing to numberless crevasses was found to be unattainable.
Being early in the season and after a considerable snow-fall,
however, the party in question found the crevasses mostly
covered, and they were aided, moreover, by Mr. Harper’s skill
and knowledge of Alpine work.</p>

<p>Again, in January 1891, Messrs. Harper and Johnson visited
the Tasman Glacier, and besides attaining a high saddle (about
7,500 feet) in the Malte Brun Range and making a nearly complete
ascent of Mount Sealy, secured a fine collection of photographs.</p>

<hr class="large" />

<p>Such, in brief, is a history of what Alpine work has been accomplished
amongst the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Other
glacier excursions, it is true, there have been, but they are few,
and with the exception of the expeditions of Mr. Sealy and the
Government Survey to the Godley and Classen Glaciers farther
north, and of a few attempts to climb Mount Earnslaw in the
Southern Lake district, are not worthy of much note as Alpine
expeditions, undertaken in the orthodox manner with axe and
rope.</p>

<p>As these lines are being penned the New Zealand Alpine
Club is in process of formation, and the writer hears with pleasure
of the probabilities of success which are likely to attend the
efforts of the promoters of the club.</p>

<p>Letters of advice and encouragement from prominent members
of the English Alpine Club have at various times come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>hand, and the friendly interest of mountain explorers of the
early days of the colony gives promise of an auspicious birth
to one of those bodies of enthusiasts whose aims may not be mercenary
and self-seeking, but whose operations may contribute
their little unit to the art, literature, and scientific observation
of the times.</p>

<p>Who can say what the future may bring forth in the matter
of Alpine climbing in New Zealand? There is an immense
field&mdash;magnificent glaciers and noble peaks without number, as
yet practically untouched.</p>

<p>One can already see visions of parties of enthusiasts threading
their way amongst intricate ice-falls, cutting steps up hard
ice slopes, conquering by persistent effort splendid rock peaks,
drinking in the glories of a new and fascinating world. Not
climbing from a gymnast’s point of view, but climbing because&mdash;why?
They cannot tell you why; but because they feel
and know the physical and spiritual benefits of a closer contact
with Nature, with an Omnipotent and Ever-guiding Hand,
which rules all things and creates a heaven even upon earth.</p>

ALPINE TERMS.</i></h3>


<p><em>Arête.</em>&mdash;A ridge either of rock, ice, or snow, or combinations of
all three.</p>

<p><em>Bergschrund.</em>&mdash;The crevasse or deep moat almost invariably
found between the sides and upper portions of a glacier or ice slope
and the rocks above, or the permanent clinging ice above, as the
case may be. Of late the meaning of the term has become extended,
and almost any crevasse in the upper parts of a glacier
with one lip higher than the other comes under the designation.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em>&mdash;Saddle, or dip in a ridge.</p>

<p><em>Cornice.</em>&mdash;The overhanging edge of an <em>arête</em> caused by drifting
snow.</p>

<p><em>Couloir.</em>&mdash;A ditch or deep gully in the mountain side; in the
upper regions being usually floored with ice and swept by avalanches.</p>

<p><em>Crevasse.</em>&mdash;The rent caused by fracture of the ice under tension.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gendarme</i>, or <em>rock tower</em>.&mdash;A mass of rock on the crest of an
<em>arête</em>.</p>

<p><em>Moraine.</em>&mdash;The accumulation of detritus which has fallen from
the mountains on to the ice and is carried down upon it.</p>

<p><em>Névé</em>, or <em>firn</em>.&mdash;Snow in a transition stage between snow and
ice. The large fields of this feeding a glacier are spoken of as the
<em>névés</em> of the glacier.</p>

<p><em>Séracs.</em>&mdash;Blocks of ice broken into polyhedral masses (mostly
cubic) by the body of the ice being crevassed in various lines of
fracture. So called from the resemblance the blocks bear to a
certain kind of cheese.</p>

<p><em>Shale slips</em> and <em>shingle and boulder fans</em> are of very common
occurrence in the New Zealand mountains and are caused by the
discharge of detritus down <em>couloirs</em>, from which when emerging
it spreads out into fan-shaped slopes.</p>
